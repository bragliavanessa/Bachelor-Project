In this study, therefore, we analyzed the structures of the N-glycans of Cha o1. The N-glycans were liberated by hydrazinolysis from purified Cha o 1, and the resulting sugar chains were N-acetylated and pyridylaminated. The structures of pyridylaminated N-glycans were analyzed by a combination of exoglycosidase digestion, two dimensional (2D-) sugar chain mapping, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis.

Temperature and precipitation anomalies between 1 x CO2 and 2 x CO2 runs were combined with baseline observed weather data for both countries for the 1980-1989 period. Forecast seasonal fire weather severity was similar for the four GCMs, indicating large increases in the areal extent of extreme fire danger in both countries under a 2 x CO2 climate scenario. A monthly analysis, using the Canadian GCM, showed an earlier start to the fire season, and significant increases in the area experiencing high to extreme fire danger in both Canada and Russia, particularly during June and July. Climate change as forecast has serious implications for forest fire management in both countries. More severe fire weather, coupled with continued economic constraints and downsizing, mean more fire activity in the future is a virtual certainty. The likely response will be a restructuring of protection priorities to support more intensive protection of smaller, high-value areas, and a return to natural fire regimes over larger areas of both Canada and Russia, with resultant significant impacts on the carbon budget.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/climate-change-forest-fire-potential-russian-canadian-boreal-forests-16"},{"title":"Small Spacecraft System-level Design and Optimization for Interplanetary Trajectories","type":"conference_proceedings","authors":[{"first_name":"Sara C.","last_name":"Spangelo"},{"first_name":"Benjamin W.","last_name":"Longmier"}],"year":2014,"source":"AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference","identifiers":{"isbn":"978-1-62410-308-7","scopus":"2-s2.0-84906280112","pui":"373787886","doi":"10.2514/6.2014-4125","sgr":"84906280112"},"websites":["http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2014-4125"],"month":8,"publisher":"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","day":4,"city":"Reston, Virginia","id":"d026d9f9-5d83-3c23-b1c4-2a23dc3c9f98","abstract":"The feasibility of an interplanetary mission for a CubeSat, a type of miniaturized spacecraft, that uses an emerging technology, the CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (CAT) is investigated. CAT is a high delta-V propulsion system that uses a high-density plasma source that has been miniaturized for small spacecraft applications. An initial feasibility assessment that demonstrated escaping Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and achieving Earth-escape trajectories with a 3U CubeSat and this thruster technology was demonstrated in previous work. We examine a mission architecture for a small spacecraft that begins in Earth orbits such as LEO and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) which escapes Earth orbit and travels to Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn. The goal was to minimize travel time to reach the destinations and considering trade-offs between spacecraft dry mass, fuel mass, and solar power array size. Sensitivities to spacecraft dry mass and available power are considered. CubeSats are extremely size, mass, and power constrained, and their subsystems are tightly coupled, limiting their performance potential. System-level modeling, simulation, and optimization approaches are necessary to find feasible and optimal operational solutions to ensure system-level interactions are modeled. Thus, propulsion, power/energy, attitude, and orbit transfer models are integrated to enable systems-level analysis and trades. The CAT technology broadens the possible missions achievable with small satellites. In particular, this technology enables more sophisticated maneuvers by small spacecraft such as polar orbit insertion from equatorial orbits, LEO to GEO transfers, Earth-escape trajectories, and transfers to other interplanetary bodies. This work lays the groundwork for upcoming CubeSat launch opportunities and supports future development of interplanetary and constellation CubeSat and small satellite mission concepts.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/small-spacecraft-systemlevel-design-optimization-interplanetary-trajectories"},{"title":"Trade Union Education Survey","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Starr"}],"year":1951,"source":"Labor and Nation","keywords":["+motion pictures and popular culture","+radio","Glende, Phil","labor","labor and radio","labor, and film","labor, and motion pictures","motion pictures","office","radio, and labor"],"pages":"55-80","volume":"7","issue":"4","id":"fde8c02d-54d9-3b15-a9f9-677f482dcb52","abstract":" Starr summarizes a survey of labor union educational practices in 1951.

Overexpression of the CDH12 protein in ACC-M cells infected with an adenovirus vector containing CDH12 enhanced the invasive and migratory ability of ACC-M cells in vitro compared to ACC-M cells infected with empty vector. Likewise, knockdown of CDH12 by small interfering RNA efficiently inhibited the invasion and migration of ACC-M cells in vitro.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the quality of life of school-aged heart transplant recipients and to identify the key factors they believe affect their quality of life. DESIGN: Focused ethnography. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Eleven children (7 girls, 4 boys) between the ages of 6 and 12 years (mean 9.1 years) who had received a transplant at least 6 months earlier were recruited from a large children's hospital. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Semistructured interviews were conducted in private locations. Data were analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison. RESULTS: The children described their quality of life as \"mostly good,\" yet reported that life was \"easy and not easy.\" Ten factors that affected the children's quality of life were Doing Things/Going Places, Favorite School Activities, Hard Things About School, Being With Friends and Family, Doing Things/Going Places With Friends and Family, Interactions With Friends and Family, Taking Care of My Heart, My Body, The Transplant Team, and Other Health Problems. Based on similarities in meaning, these factors were combined into 3 themes: Doing What Kids Do, Being With Friends and Family, and Being a Heart Transplant Kid. The themes and factors can provide useful direction for interventions aimed at improving the quality of life for children after heart transplantation.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/shoes-childrens-quality-life-after-heart-transplantation-2"},{"title":"Plastic Synaptic Networks of the Amygdala for the Acquisition, Expression, and Extinction of Conditioned Fear","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"H.

In part, this results from the realization that abnormalities in fear learning mechanisms likely participate in the development and/or maintenance of human anxiety disorders. The simplicity and robustness of this learning paradigm, coupled with the fact that the underlying circuitry is evolutionarily well conserved, make it an ideal model to study the basic biology of memory and identify genetic factors and neuronal systems that regulate the normal and pathological expressions of learned fear. Critical advances have been made in determining how modified neuronal functions upon fear acquisition become stabilized during fear memory consolidation and how these processes are controlled in the course of fear memory extinction. With these advances came the realization that activity in remote neuronal networks must be coordinated for these events to take place. In this paper, we review these mechanisms of coordinated network activity and the molecular cascades leading to enduring fear memory, and allowing for their extinction. We will focus on Pavlovian fear conditioning as a model and the amygdala as a key component for the acquisition and extinction of fear responses.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/plastic-synaptic-networks-amygdala-acquisition-expression-extinction-conditioned-fear"},{"title":"Value Trace Problems for Graph Theory Algorithms in Java Programming Learning Assistant System","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Nobuo","last_name":"Funabiki"},{"first_name":"Khin Khin","last_name":"Zaw"},{"first_name":"Minoru","last_name":"Kuribayashi"},{"first_name":"Wen-Chung","last_name":"Kao"}],"year":2017,"source":"International Journal of Information and Education Technology","identifiers":{"issn":"20103689","doi":"10.18178/ijiet.2017.7.5.897"},"pages":"374-379","volume":"7","issue":"5","websites":["http://www.ijiet.org/show-87-1014-1.html"],"id":"9aa69e9b-c0ed-3bff-bf5c-18690e6696aa","abstract":"Abstract—Code reading is very important in programming educations for students.

This value trace problem asks students to trace the actual values of important variables in a Java code implementing a fundamental data structure or an algorithm. In this paper, we study value trace problems for graph theory algorithms. First, using the Dijkstra algorithm, we analyze the requirements and points in a value trace problem for this representative graph theory algorithm. Then, we generate problems for the two graph theory algorithms to examine their problem size and the effectiveness in Java programming studies.

Electrical bias stress measurements which can serve as a figure of merit for performance stability for a TFT device reveal Sr- and Ba-doped semiconductors to exhibit enhanced electrical stability and reduced threshold voltage shift compared to IGZO irrespective of the process temperature and preparation method.

The link between the HMNH structure and the sense of enantioinduction is demonstrated by use of simple transition state models.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/iron-group-hydrides-noyori-bifunctional-catalysis"},{"title":"Reproduction in a typical breeder: costs,currencies and complications in the aspic viper","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Xavier","last_name":"Bonnet"},{"first_name":"Olivier","last_name":"Lourdais"},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Shine"},{"first_name":"Guy","last_name":"Naulleau"}],"year":2002,"source":"Ecology","identifiers":{"isbn":"0012-9658","issn":"0012-9658","pmid":"213","doi":"10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2124:RIATCB]2.0.CO;2"},"keywords":["Femelle Reproduction R‚serves Vipera aspis","breeding frequency","breeding frequency capital breeders cost of reprod","capital breeders","cost of reproduction","energy storage","lifetime","relative clutch mass","reproductive effort","reproductive success","semelparity","snakes","vipera aspis"],"pages":"2124-2135","volume":"83","issue":"8","websites":["<Go to ISI>://WOS:000177434200007"],"id":"d036b201-d12a-3b90-9967-aec181bba0e2","abstract":"Female aspic vipers (Vipera aspis) are \"capital breeders,\" and delay reproduction until they have amassed large energy reserves. Data from an eight-year mark-recapture study on free-ranging vipers suggest that potential costs of reproduction were high for these animals, in terms of survival as well as growth and energy storage. Females that reproduced experienced higher mortality rates than nonreproductive females and, hence, exhibited a tendency toward semelparity, grew less, and devoted most of their energy stores to reproduction. Both the depletion of body reserves and the low Survival of reproductive females translated into significant costs (decrements of lifetime reproductive success [LRS]). However, the cessation of growth during pregnancy had no detectable effect on LRS. Most females produced only a single litter during their lifetimes. A female's \"costs\" in energy terms were not negatively correlated with her future reproductive output, probably because female vipers vary considerably in the rate at which they can accumulate energy. This notion is supported by the observations that (1) females with higher initial body reserves expended more energy during reproduction, and (2) females that accumulated energy more rapidly after parturition were more likely to survive and to breed again. This kind of variation among females masks any underlying trade-off between current reproductive effort and probable future reproductive success. Despite this complication, a strong link between rates of survival and postreproductive mass recovery suggests that changes in body reserves govern reproductive effort in this species.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/reproduction-typical-breeder-costscurrencies-complications-aspic-viper"},{"title":"Controllable Growth of Vertical Heterostructure GaTexSe1-x/Si by Molecular Beam Epitaxy.","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Shanshan","last_name":"Liu"},{"first_name":"Xiang","last_name":"Yuan"},{"first_name":"Peng","last_name":"Wang"},{"first_name":"Zhi-Gang","last_name":"Chen"},{"first_name":"Lei","last_name":"Tang"},{"first_name":"Enze","last_name":"Zhang"},{"first_name":"Cheng","last_name":"Zhang"},{"first_name":"Yanwen","last_name":"Liu"},{"first_name":"Weiyi","last_name":"Wang"},{"first_name":"Cong","last_name":"Liu"},{"first_name":"Chen","last_name":"Chen"},{"first_name":"Jin","last_name":"Zou"},{"first_name":"Weida","last_name":"Hu"},{"first_name":"Faxian","last_name":"Xiu"}],"year":2015,"source":"ACS nano","identifiers":{"issn":"1936-086X","doi":"10.1021/acsnano.5b03796","isbn":"1936-0851","pmid":"26234804"},"keywords":["1","2","2d","3","4 black phosphorus","5","6 transition","gate x se 1","h-bn","he surging renewal of","homogeneity","materials such as graphene","molecular beam epitaxy","two-dimensional","two-dimensional alloy","à x"],"pages":"8592-8","volume":"9","issue":"8","websites":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5b03796"],"id":"9abaca46-7fd6-3ef7-81ee-3040564a4f01","abstract":"Two dimensional (2D) alloys, especially transition metal dichalcogenides, have attracted intense attention owing to their band-gap tunability and potential optoelectrical applications.

We achieve a layer-by-layer growth mode with uniform distribution of Ga, Te, and Se elements across 2 in. wafers. Raman spectroscopy was carried out to explore the composition-dependent vibration frequency of phonons, which matches well with the modified random-element-isodisplacement model. Highly efficient photodiode arrays were also built by depositing few-layer GaTe0.64Se0.36 on n-type Si substrates. These p-n junctions have steady rectification characteristics with a rectifying ratio exceeding 300 and a high external quantum efficiency around 50%. We further measured more devices on MBE-grown GaTexSe1-x/Si heterostructures across the full range to explore the composition-dependent external quantum efficiency. Our study opens a new avenue for the controllable growth of 2D alloys with wafer-scale homogeneity, which is a prominent challenge in 2D material research.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/controllable-growth-vertical-heterostructure-gatexse1xsi-molecular-beam-epitaxy"},{"title":"'Urine testing is a waste of time': Newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes patients' perceptions of self-monitoring","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"J.","last_name":"Lawton","scopus_author_id":"7102181129"},{"first_name":"E.","last_name":"Peel","scopus_author_id":"7004189057"},{"first_name":"M.","last_name":"Douglas","scopus_author_id":"7202715872"},{"first_name":"O.","last_name":"Parry","scopus_author_id":"22136400800"}],"year":2004,"source":"Diabetic Medicine","identifiers":{"sgr":"4544228929","pmid":"15317613","scopus":"2-s2.0-4544228929","pui":"39215328","isbn":"0742-3071","issn":"07423071","doi":"10.1111/j.1464-5491.2004.01286.x"},"keywords":["Blood glucose meter","Self-monitoring","Type 2 diabetes","Urine testing"],"pages":"1045-1048","volume":"21","issue":"9","month":9,"id":"d036b7fb-7c87-3c53-a153-0c48e7fd0143","abstract":"To date, there is no convincing evidence that non-insulin treated patients who undertake self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) have better glycaemic control than those who test their urine. This has led to a recommendation that non-insulin dependent patients undertake urine testing, which is the cheaper option. This recommendation does not take account of patients’ experiences and views. This study explores the respective merits of urine testing and SBGM from the perspectives of newly diagnosed patients with Type 2 diabetes. Qualitative study using repeat in-depth interviews with 40 patients. Patients were interviewed three times at 6-monthly intervals over 1 year. Patients were recruited from hospital clinics and general practices in Lothian, Scotland. The study was informed by grounded theory, which involves concurrent data collection and analysis. Patients reported strongly negative views of urine testing, particularly when they compared it with SBGM. Patients perceived urine testing as less convenient, less hygienic and less accurate than SBGM. Most patients assumed that blood glucose meters were given to those with a more advanced or serious form of diabetes. This could have implications for how they thought about their own disease. Patients often interpreted negative urine results as indicating that they could not have diabetes. Professionals should be aware of the meanings and understandings patients attach to the receipt and use of different types of self-monitoring equipment. Guidelines that promote the use of consistent criteria for equipment allocation are required. The manner in which negative urine results are conveyed needs to be reconsidered. Diabet. Med.

It occurs acutely in about 7% of patients who have limb fractures, limb surgery, or other injuries. Many cases resolve within the first year, with a smaller subset progressing to the chronic form. This transition is often paralleled by a change from \"warm complex regional pain syndrome,\" with inflammatory characteristics dominant, to \"cold complex regional pain syndrome\" in which autonomic features dominate. Multiple peripheral and central mechanisms seem to be involved, the relative contributions of which may differ between individuals and over time. Possible contributors include peripheral and central sensitization, autonomic changes and sympatho-afferent coupling, inflammatory and immune alterations, brain changes, and genetic and psychological factors. The syndrome is diagnosed purely on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. Effective management of the chronic form of the syndrome is often challenging. Few high quality randomized controlled trials are available to support the efficacy of the most commonly used interventions. Reviews of available randomized trials suggest that physical and occupational therapy (including graded motor imagery and mirror therapy), bisphosphonates, calcitonin, subanesthetic intravenous ketamine, free radical scavengers, oral corticosteroids, and spinal cord stimulation may be effective treatments. Multidisciplinary clinical care, which centers around functionally focused therapies is recommended. Other interventions are used to facilitate engagement in functional therapies and to improve quality of life.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-269"},{"title":"Women's Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC)","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Women","last_name":"Health"}],"year":2013,"source":"African Journal of Reproductive Health","keywords":["Uganda","health unit","maternal death","risk factors"],"pages":"47-53","volume":"5","issue":"3","id":"d036bed7-4ef9-3e73-90d5-1dc3ad74fa33","abstract":"This study was conducted to assess the magnitude of maternal deaths in health units in Uganda, and the risk factors associated with such deaths.

The effects of these treatments on several quality factors of the fruits were investigated. Control package samples (kept at 30C without atmosphere modification) had the highest number of live insects as well as yeast and mold colony counts (P < .0.05). pH values of the MAP samples stored at 30C were less than the other treatments. Water activity was reduced during the storage in all the samples. Fruit blemishing in the high CO2 MAP samples was similar to that of the controls. However, the least blemishing was at - 18C. The MAP containing 85% CO2+.3%O2+.12% N2 and 75% CO2+.12% O2 were chosen as the best methods of preservation and quality maintenance of sayer dates with limited effects on the appearance of physiological disorder signs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The effect of different preservation techniques (high CO2 modified atmosphere packaging [MPA], cool storage and freezing) on insect elimination and quality of sayer date fruits was investigated. As no off-odor or off-flavor due to anaerobiosis was reported during the experiments, sayer dates were considered to be resistant to high CO2 concentration or low oxygen probably due to their low respiration rate. Both MPA containing 85% CO2 and freezing eliminated insects, inhibited mold growth, reduced sugar accumulation and produced negligible blemishing and pH reduction, and therefore were considered appropriate for preservation of sayer dates. © 2009 The Author(s).

This book has shown that William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, and John Millington Synge all looked to the past — and to contemporary survivals of the past — as it was envisaged by comparative scientists or (in the case of Lady Gregory) by travellers and colonialists who had themselves assimilated the lessons of comparative science. For all the serendipity and anti-scientism of Yeats's approach, there was a pattern to the way he used comparative anthropology and mythology. For Synge, the iconoclasm of his vision owed much to his early acceptance that the romantic primitivism of Celticism was utterly outdated by the end of the 19th century because of the revelations made by comparative philologists, mythologists, and anthropologists. Lady Gregory's primitivism was stubbornly romantic and, despite knowing many comparative mythologists and anthropologists personally, science did not make her vision change.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/vii-conclusion"},{"title":"Early expression of glutamate transporter proteins in ramified microglia after controlled cortical impact injury in the rat.","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"F K","last_name":"van Landeghem"},{"first_name":"J F","last_name":"Stover"},{"first_name":"I","last_name":"Bechmann"},{"first_name":"W","last_name":"Brück"},{"first_name":"a","last_name":"Unterberg"},{"first_name":"C","last_name":"Bührer"},{"first_name":"a","last_name":"von Deimling"}],"year":2001,"source":"Glia","identifiers":{"issn":"0894-1491","doi":"10.1002/glia.1082","pmid":"11494408"},"keywords":["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters: metabolism","Amino Acid Transport System X-AG","Animals","Astrocytes","Astrocytes: cytology","Astrocytes: metabolism","Brain Injuries","Brain Injuries: metabolism","Brain Injuries: pathology","Brain Injuries: physiopathology","Cerebral Cortex","Cerebral Cortex: injuries","Cerebral Cortex: metabolism","Cerebral Cortex: physiopathology","Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2","Extracellular Space","Extracellular Space: metabolism","Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein","Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein: metabolism","Glutamic Acid","Glutamic Acid: cerebrospinal fluid","Hippocampus","Hippocampus: metabolism","Hippocampus: pathology","Hippocampus: physiopathology","Immunohistochemistry","Lectins","Lectins: diagnostic use","Macrophages","Macrophages: cytology","Macrophages: metabolism","Male","Microglia","Microglia: cytology","Microglia: metabolism","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Receptors, Neurotransmitter","Receptors, Neurotransmitter: metabolism","Thalamus","Thalamus: metabolism","Thalamus: pathology","Thalamus: physiopathology","Time Factors"],"pages":"167-79","volume":"35","issue":"3","websites":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11494408"],"month":9,"id":"54a7bfd3-89fe-37ed-9503-594b134fb108","accessed":[2015,1,10],"abstract":"Traumatic brain injury is followed by increased extracellular glutamate concentration. Uptake of glutamate is mainly mediated by the glial glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT-1. Extent and distribution of GLAST and GLT-1 were studied in a rat model of controlled cortical impact injury (CCII). Western Blot analysis revealed lowest levels of GLAST and GLT-1 with a decrease by 40%-54% and 42%-49% between 24 and 72 h posttrauma. By 8 h after CCII, CSF glutamate levels were increased (10.5 microM vs. 2.56 microM in controls; P < 0.001), reaching maximum values by 48 h. A significant increase in de novo GLAST and GLT-1 expressing ramified microglia was observed within 4 h, reached a stable level by 48 h, and remained high up to 72 h after CCII. Furthermore, ramified microglia de novo expressed the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 after CCII. Following CCII, GLAST/GLT-1 and GFAP coexpressing astrocytes were immediately reduced, reaching minimum levels within 8 h. This reduction of expression could be either due to protein downregulation or loss of astrocytes. At 72 h, a marked population of GLAST- and GLT-1-positive reactive astrocytes appeared. These results support the hypothesis that reduced astrocytic GLAST and GLT-1 protein levels following CCII contribute to evolving secondary injury. Microglia are capable of de novo expressing glutamate transporter proteins, indicating that the expression of glial and neuronal glutamate transporters is not restricted to a specific glial or neuronal lineage. Ramified microglia may play an important compensatory role in the early regulation of extracellular glutamate after CCII.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/early-expression-glutamate-transporter-proteins-ramified-microglia-after-controlled-cortical-impact-1"},{"title":"On syndrome decoding for Slepian-Wolf coding based on convolutional and turbo codes","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"Cappellari","scopus_author_id":"56429259000"}],"year":2010,"source":"IEEE Communications Letters","identifiers":{"arxiv":"0912.0797","sgr":"77953205042","scopus":"2-s2.0-77953205042","pui":"358961259","issn":"10897798","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.06.100283"},"keywords":["Message-passing","Slepian-Wolf coding","Source coding","Syndrome-based binning","Turbo codes"],"pages":"554-556","volume":"14","issue":"6","month":6,"id":"fdf96c7e-2fb9-34e3-b9fc-33d734dc13ff","abstract":"In source coding, either with or without side information at the decoder, the ultimate performance can be achieved by means of random binning.

We use extended planet formation models to analyse the results the two first runs of CoRoT, namely the initial one (IRa01) and the first long one (LRc01). We compare our calculations to the actual observations and discuss the possible origins of the differences between the two, not only in term of detection rate, but also regarding the magnitude of transiting planets parent stars. Methods: We use a galactic population synthesis model in order to calculate the characteristics of stars in the field-of-view of CoRoT. In a second step, we calculate planet formation models to derive the population of planets expected around these stars. In a third step, using planet evolution models, we calculate the radius of planets predicted by the model and estimate the probability of transit detection and confirmation by radial-velocity follow-up. Results: Our calculations show that the present day CoRoT detection rate, based only on IRa01 and LRc01, is a factor 5 lower than the one predicted assuming all target are dwarf stars. On the other hand, the two detection rates become similar if one assumes some contamination of CoRoT targets by giant stars, or some less optimistic determinations of the noise level, the limiting signal-to-noise ratio and radial velocity follow-up performances. However, in all the cases we have considered, the majority of transits are found around faint stars, in conflict with the actual CoRoT detections.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/planet-formation-nucleatedinstability-comparison-two-first-corot-runs"},{"title":"A New Convenient Preparation of Thiol Esters Utilizing <i>N</i> -Acylbenzotriazoles","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Katritzky"},{"first_name":"Aleksandr","last_name":"Shestopalov"},{"first_name":"Kazuyuki","last_name":"Suzuki"}],"year":2004,"source":"Synthesis","identifiers":{"isbn":"0039-7881","scopus":"2-s2.0-4043117862","issn":"0039-7881","pui":"39062459","doi":"10.1055/s-2004-829126","sgr":"4043117862"},"pages":"1806-1813","volume":"2004","issue":"11","websites":["http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2004-829126"],"month":7,"day":1,"id":"e73506de-0fa6-326a-9dbe-4ce6bb84c81e","abstract":"Diverse thiol esters were synthesized in good to excellent yields (76-99%) by reactions of thiophenol, benzyl mercaptan, ethyl mercaptoacetate, and mercaptoacetic acid with N-acylbenzotriazoles under mild conditions.

SETTING: This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight patients with cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in which the radionuclide localized to the parotid gland on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy were studied. METHODS: All patients underwent wide local excision of the tumor and intraparotid sentinel node biopsy using intraoperative gamma probe localization. RESULTS: There were 25 men and 3 women ranging in age from 34 to 81 years. The primary site was on the auricle in 14 patients: temple, 4; forehead, 5; cheek, 3; and on the neck in 2 patients, respectively. The mean Breslow thickness was 2.3 mm (range, 0.9-7.0 mm). In 27 of 28 patients, an intraparotid SLN was identified. In one patient, final pathology did not reveal lymphoid tissue despite a high count in the parotid tissue excised. Median number of SLN per patient was two. Six patients had microscopic metastases in the SLN. In two of these patients, additional microscopic lymph node metastases were found in the neck after subsequent formal  lymphadenectomy. The pathologic staging for the group (n = 14) was: stage 1B, 4;  2A, 4; stage 2B, 3; and stage 3B, 3 patients, respectively. All patients are alive and without evidence of disease (mean follow up, 31 months). There were no  surgical complications, specifically no patient experienced temporary or permanent facial paralysis.

Machining of such complex MMCs is often challenging. It is essential to optimize the controllable machining parameters to simultaneously attain manifold objectives. In the current work, response surface design is created for experiments, and Genetic algorithm (GA) combined with Principal Components Analysis (PCA) coupled Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is employed to improve the straight turning process of MMCs. The procedure is demonstrated by machining aluminum-based MMC with 25% SiC particulates. The procedure aims at identifying optimal combination of machining parameters to obtain high surface quality at lower cutting force without increasing the specific power consumption. PCA is helpful in providing the individual uncorrelated quality characteristics called as quality indices that do not have any influence on other responses. Individual quality indices have been utilized to obtain the grey relational grade through GRA. GRA has been used to alter manifold quality indices into singular column of grey relational grade as a means to change the manifold objective problem into a sole objective problem. Then, GA has been used to get the optimal parameters combination. The novelty present in this work is the avoidance of correlation existing among the quality characteristics and combining of the GRA and GA. This is an endeavor to augment the performance and accuracy of GA to solve the optimization problem associated with the turning operation. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/machining-parameters-optimization-satisfying-multiple-objectives-machining-mmcs"},{"title":"Transformed difference vegetation index (TDVI) for vegetation cover mapping","type":"conference_proceedings","authors":[{"first_name":"A.","last_name":"Bannari"},{"first_name":"H.","last_name":"Asalhi"},{"first_name":"P.M.","last_name":"Teillet"}],"year":2002,"source":"IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","identifiers":{"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026867","isbn":"0-7803-7536-X"},"pages":"3053-3055","volume":"5","issue":"C","websites":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1026867"],"publisher":"IEEE","id":"f0fe12b1-0d3e-3402-9813-3157b7d18c0c","abstract":"In this study, we present a new vegetation index, the TDVI: Transformed Difference Vegetation Index.

This thesis is considered for two possible roles: first, as a thesis to which John Locke might have been committed in his writings on property; and second, as a thesis of independent plausibility that could serve as part of a defensible contemporary theory of property rights. Understanding Locke as committed to the thesis of makers' rights has seemed to many of the best known recent Locke scholars to explain and unify Locke's various claims about property in a way that more traditional \"labor-mixing\" interpretations cannot. This paper argues that there is in fact no convincing evidence in Locke's texts to suggest any commitment to the thesis of makers' rights for humans. Further, not only does a version of the traditional labor-mixing argument yield a much superior interpretation of Locke's writings, it is an argument that is far more convincing than makers' rights arguments, quite independent of its usefulness in the interpretation of Locke's theory.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/makers-rights"},{"title":"Spontaneous appendicocutaneous fistula: case report and literature review.","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"G","last_name":"Nanni"},{"first_name":"C","last_name":"Bergamini"},{"first_name":"M","last_name":"Bertoncini"}],"year":1981,"source":"Diseases of the colon and rectum","identifiers":{"issn":"0012-3706","pmid":"7227133"},"keywords":["Aged","Appendix","Female","Fistula","Fistula: radiography","Fistula: surgery","Humans","Intestinal Fistula","Intestinal Fistula: radiography","Intestinal Fistula: surgery","Methods","Skin Diseases","Skin Diseases: radiography","Skin Diseases: surgery"],"pages":"187-90","volume":"24","issue":"3","websites":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7227133"],"month":4,"id":"90f6cb51-8f5b-3ce6-a944-88478220cfb2","accessed":[2014,11,16],"abstract":"A report is presented describing an exceptional case of spontaneous appendicocutaneous fistula (only six cases in the literature).

A net attached to a sledge maneuvered by a SCUBA diver who uses operating switches on a steering handle to adjust the altitude of the sledge and the position of the tickler chains to ensure that the footcloth of the mouth of the net remains in constant contact with the bottom surface. Video camera, flow meter, compass, and dive computers are positioned on the sledge net in the view of the diver. Given that the system can attain speeds of 70 cm s-1, the net can be employed to capture highly mobile fish. Unlike most boat-based net sampling methods, the use of propulsion vehicles means that there are no sound or vibration disturbances due to the boat and tow ropes typically used to maneuver these types of sampling nets. Marine fauna was collected at monthly intervals over a two-year period in a sampling area along the southern coast of Hokkaido, Japan. A total of 2641 specimens comprising 61 species and including five species which were the first records for the region were collected. These findings suggest that the new sledge net system employing propulsion vehicles was effective for sampling demersal juveniles, particularly in situations where sledge nets towed by boats or push nets cannot be deployed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that PbMn 7 O 12 exhibits rich physical properties from interplay among charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom and rich structural properties. PbMn 7 O 12 crystallizes in space group R3̅ near room temperature and shows a structural phase transition at T CO = 397 K to a cubic structure in space group Im3̅ ; the Im3̅ -to-R3̅ transition is associated with charge ordering. Below T OO = 294 K, a structural modulation transition associated with orbital ordering takes place. There are two magnetic transitions with Neél temperatures of T N1 = 83 K and T N2 = 77 K and probably a lock-in transition at T N3 = 43 K (on cooling). There is huge hysteresis on specific heat (between ∼37 and 65 K at 0 Oe), dielectric constant (between ∼20 and 70 K at 0 Oe), and dc and ac magnetic susceptibilities around the lock-in transition. Sharp dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and pyroelectric current anomalies are observed at T N2 , indicating that electric polarization is developed at this magnetic transition, and PbMn 7 O 12 perovskite is a spin-driven multiferroic. Polarization of PbMn 7 O 12 is measured to be ∼4 μC/m 2 .

METHODS: A simple, short-term model was used to evaluate the costs and effects of treatment with IDeg versus IGlar U100 over a 12-month period in patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. New-to-market basal insulin analogues were evaluated in scenario analyses. RESULTS: IDeg is dominant (more effective and less costly) versus IGlar U100 in patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM on a basal-only therapy regimen (T2DM ), and is cost-effective versus IGlar U100 in patients with T2DM on a basal-bolus regimen (T2DM ). In T1DM, lower costs are primarily driven by lower insulin costs, as a result of a lower daily dose of IDeg. In T2DM , lower overall costs with IDeg are driven by lower costs of severe hypoglycaemic events due to the significant reduction in number of events with IDeg versus IGlar U100. Improvements in clinical outcomes in all three patient groups are a result of the reduced incidence of hypoglycaemic events. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the results are robust. Scenario analyses versus two new-to-market basal insulin analogues indicate that in patients with T1DM and T2DM , IDeg is likely to be highly cost-effective versus IGlar biosimilar Abasaglar and dominant versus IGlar U300 (Toujeo ). In T2DM , IDeg is likely to be cost-effective versus both comparators, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below the accepted threshold. CONCLUSION: IDeg is a cost-effective alternative to IGlar U100 for patients with diabetes in the UK, and it also likely to be cost-effective versus two new-to-market basal insulin analogues.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/costeffectiveness-insulin-degludec-versus-insulin-glargine-adults-type-1-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-4"},{"title":"Efficacy of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy in the Treatment of PTSD: A Systematic Review ","type":"generic","authors":[{"first_name":"R","last_name":"Goncalves"},{"first_name":"I","last_name":"Figueira"},{"first_name":"P","last_name":"Ventura"}],"year":2012,"source":"PloS one ","identifiers":{"isbn":"EN :1932-6203","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048469"},"websites":["http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048469&representation=PDF"],"publisher":"Public Library of Science (185 Berry Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco CA 94107, United States) ","city":"R.

To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in the treatment of PTSD, we performed a systematic review of published articles using the following electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and PILOTS. Eligibility criteria included the use of patients diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the use of virtual reality for performing exposure. 10 articles were selected, seven of which showed that VRET produced statistically significant results in comparison to the waiting list. However, no difference was found between VRET and exposure treatment. Of these 10, four were randomized, two were controlled but not randomized and four were non-controlled. The majority of the articles used head-mounted display virtual reality (VR) equipment and VR systems specific for the population that was being treated. Dropout rates do not seem to be lower than in traditional exposure treatment. However, there are a few limitations. Because this is a new field of research, there are few studies in the literature. There is also a need to standardize the number of sessions used. The randomized studies were analyzed to assess the quality of the methodology, and important deficiencies were noted, such as the non-use of intent-to- treat-analysis and the absence of description of possible concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Preliminary data suggest that VRET is as efficacious as traditional exposure treatment and can be especially useful in the treatment of patients who are resistant to traditional exposure.  2012 Goncalves et al.\\n","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/efficacy-virtual-reality-exposure-therapy-treatment-ptsd-systematic-review-8"},{"title":"Environmental risks at Finnish shooting ranges - A case study","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Jaana","last_name":"Sorvari","scopus_author_id":"22136656200"}],"year":2007,"source":"Human and Ecological Risk Assessment","identifiers":{"issn":"10807039","sgr":"34848852207","doi":"10.1080/10807030701506124","pii":"782466514","isbn":"1080-7039","scopus":"2-s2.0-34848852207","pui":"47493760"},"keywords":["Contamination","Ecological risk","Health risk","Risk assessment","Shooting range"],"pages":"1111-1146","volume":"13","issue":"5","month":9,"id":"9abb12ab-bf07-3558-821c-99bb0c621430","abstract":"We studied three Finnish shooting ranges in order to define the extent of the risks associated with elevated environmental concentrations of metals and PAHs. A scoring system revealed that lead, arsenic, and antimony were the most critical contaminants. On Site 3, the concentration of lead in groundwater exceeded the drinking water standard indicating evident health risks. For the remaining two sites we calculated Acceptable Daily Doses (ADD) based on the Reasonable Maximum Exposure (RME) approach and compared them with safe exposure levels. We also used a pharmacokinetic model to determine blood lead levels (PbBs). Risks to biota were assessed using ecological benchmarks and exposure and accumulation models. Prediction of leaching was based on laboratory tests and a distribution model. The health risk assessment for lead resulted in the maximum hazard quotient (HQ) of 1.2 whereas the HQs of As and Sb remained less than 1.

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which was found in 124 of 462 children (26.8%), was observed to have been influenced by an increased level of eosinophils, the positivity of the skin prick test for any of the allergens tested, a decreased baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (percent predicted), a decreased maximum expiratory flow at 50% expiration as a percent of forced vital capacity, and a decreased level of κ-chain-assembled immunoglobulins. Logit analysis disclosed that the influence of all other parameters on the occurrence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was of no further statistical significance. The degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1) showed a statistically significant correlation with the eosinophil count (Spearman's r = -0.198) and FEV1(percent predicted) (Spearman's r = 0.203).

It is characterized by predominant intracortical localization and nodular architecture. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour usually demonstrates a distinctive morphological pattern with a specific glioneuronal element but occasionally, its morphological picture is heterogeneous and unspecific. Thus, considering the morphology of DNT, three different histopathological subtypes are distinguished: simple, complex, and non-specific and diffuse. The DNT lesions are often related with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIIb, which is postulated to play a role in epileptogenicity. Moreover, the accompanying inflammation process might be implicated in DNT-related epileptogenesis. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour is generally characterized by favourable prognosis and good results of surgical treatment. The pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms involved in DNT development remain uncertain. The main molecular findings are connected with BRAF alterations and activation of RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT and mTOR signalling pathways. The present review summarizes the clinical, histopathological and molecular findings of DNT.

Management of bleeding ulcers is usually unsatisfactory with conventional treatment. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) has been reported to control bleeding; however, it has not been shown to result in ulcer healing. The aim of the present study was to: (i) to investigate the efficacy and safety of APC in controlling bleeding from SRUS; and (ii) to study its efficacy in the healing of ulcer/s. METHODS Twenty-four patients with bleeding SRUS diagnosed on clinical, colonoscopic, and histological findings were randomized to receive either standard care alone (12 patients) or to undergo multiple sessions of APC in addition (12 patients). All patients were followed up to determine ulcer healing. RESULTS Twenty-four patients with a mean duration of symptoms of 12.6 +/- 4.8 months were included. Bleeding was controlled with one (n = 5) or two sessions (n = 7) of APC. Reduction in size and depth of ulcer was noted. Eight out of 12 patients who received APC had complete healing of ulcers after four to eight sessions, carried out 2-4 weeks apart. The remaining four patients had a reduction in size and depth of ulcers compared to their pretreatment appearance. All patients were advised to have a high intake of fluids, fiber and laxatives, and to undergo biofeedback and behavior modification therapy in addition to the treatment. CONCLUSIONS APC controls bleeding in patients with SRUS and it also improves the healing of these ulcers.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/healing-solitary-rectal-ulcers-multiple-sessions-argon-plasma-coagulation"},{"title":"Inhibition of breast cancer cell invasion by melatonin is mediated through regulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Lulu","last_name":"Mao","scopus_author_id":"24173817200"},{"first_name":"Lin","last_name":"Yuan","scopus_author_id":"57031094000"},{"first_name":"Lauren M.","last_name":"Slakey","scopus_author_id":"36129665400"},{"first_name":"Frank E.","last_name":"Jones","scopus_author_id":"35279512100"},{"first_name":"Matthew E.","last_name":"Burow","scopus_author_id":"7005287412"},{"first_name":"Steven M.","last_name":"Hill","scopus_author_id":"7402766036"}],"year":2010,"source":"Breast Cancer Research","identifiers":{"issn":"14655411","sgr":"79960425073","doi":"10.1186/bcr2794","isbn":"1465-542X (Electronic)\\r1465-5411 (Linking)","pmid":"21167057","scopus":"2-s2.0-79960425073","pui":"362155511"},"volume":"12","issue":"6","month":12,"day":17,"id":"fdf97696-713d-3b7b-a7c1-bd3b0c649529","abstract":"Introduction: The pineal gland hormone, melatonin, has been shown by numerous studies to inhibit the proliferation of estrogen receptor a (ERa)-positive breast cancer cell lines. Here, we investigated the role of melatonin in the regulation of breast cancer cell invasion. Methods: Three invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cell clones -MCF-7/6, MCF-7/Her2.1, and MCF-7/CXCR4 cells -were employed in these studies. All three cell lines exhibited elevated phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as determined by Western blot analysis. The effect of melatonin on the invasive potential of these human breast cancer cells was examined by matrigel invasion chamber assays. The expression and proteinase activity of two matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP-2 and MMP-9, were analyzed by Western blot analysis and gelatin zymography, respectively. Results: Melatonin (10 -9 M) significantly suppressed the invasive potential of MCF-7/6 and MCF-7/Her2.1 cells as measured by matrigel invasion chamber assays, and significantly repressed the proteinase activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In MCF-7/CXCR4 cells, melatonin significantly inhibited stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) induced cell invasion and activity of MMP-9. Elevated expression of the MT1 melatonin receptor further enhanced, while luzindole, an MT1/MT2 antagonist, abrogated melatonin's anti-invasive effect, suggesting that melatonin's effect on invasion is mediated, principally, through the MT1 receptor. Furthermore, melatonin repressed the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in MCF-7/Her2.1 cells and blocked stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) induced p38 phosphorylation in MCF-7/CXCR4 cells. SB230580, a p38 inhibitor, was able to mimic, while transfection of the cells with a constitutively-active MKK6b construct blocked melatonin's effect on cell invasion, suggesting that the anti-invasive action of melatonin is mediated through the p38 pathway. Conclusions: Melatonin exerts an inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell invasion through down-regulation of the p38 pathway, and inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/inhibition-breast-cancer-cell-invasion-melatonin-mediated-through-regulation-p38-mitogenactivated-pr-4"},{"title":"Dr. Goldmann replies","type":"generic","authors":[{"first_name":"Hans","last_name":"Goldmann","scopus_author_id":"7004153500"}],"year":1953,"source":"American Journal of Ophthalmology","identifiers":{"scopus":"2-s2.0-50449116052","issn":"00029394","pui":"282004208","pii":"0002939453905790","sgr":"50449116052","doi":"10.1016/0002-9394(53)90579-0"},"pages":"544-545","volume":"36","issue":"4","id":"e7351bb7-7a02-38ee-b0dd-952f6c00d8bc","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/dr-goldmann-replies"},{"title":"New approach to 2D Braille device design","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"R.","last_name":"Bansevičius","scopus_author_id":"6602262626"},{"first_name":"M.","last_name":"Gudauskis","scopus_author_id":"45561168000"},{"first_name":"A.","last_name":"Žvironas","scopus_author_id":"24771393100"},{"first_name":"J.

Then perceivers rated their opinion of the target's memory and also the extent to which they would attribute the target's memory failures to lack of ability and to lack of effort. Prior to reading the script, one-third of the perceivers read an article stating that memory declines with age, one-third read an article stating that memory stays constant with age, and one-third read no article.

The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of pig genetic modification on human platelet aggregation induced by pig endothelial cells (EC). Methods and Materials: Using a Chrono-log Whole Blood Aggreg-ometer, we studied platelet aggregation after incubation of human blood with human (h) or pig (p) aortic endothelial cells (AEC) using wild-type (WT), a1,3-galactosyltransferase gene-knockout (GTKO), and various transgenic pigs expressing human complement- or coagulation-regulatory proteins. We also studied the development of TM after transplantation of hearts from two types of genetically-engineered pigs, one of which expressed hTBM. Results: Platelet aggregation induced by pAEC from GTKO pigs or by pAEC expressing complement-regulatory (CD46 and/or CD55) and/or coagulation-regulatory (TFPI or TBM) proteins was significantly reduced, particularly by GTKO.CD46.TBM pAEC (WT 53% vs GTKO.CD46.T BM 28%;p<0.01) though not to the level induced by the control hAEC (5%). When GTKO.CD46.CD55 hearts were transplanted (n=4), throm-bocytopenia (reduction in platelet count to < 50,000x103/mm3 or < 20% of baseline) and a reduction in fibrinogen (< 100,000mg/dL or <50% of baseline) developed within 21 days, indicating development of TM, confirmed by histopathology. When GTKO.CD46.TBM hearts (n=3) were transplanted, no reduction in platelet count or fibrinogen was observed. Two experiments are ongoing, but one baboon was euthanized after 52 days; there was no TM on histology. Conclusions: The absence of the Gal antigen, and transgenic expression of human complement- and/or coagulation-regulatory proteins on pAEC are all associated with reduced human platelet aggregation in vitro. Transplantation of hearts expressing TBM was associated with no (or possibly delayed) TM. The barrier of coagulation dysregulation may be overcome.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/human-platelet-aggregation-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tm-pig-cardiac-xenografts-reduced-expression-h"},{"title":"Value of rectosigmoidoscopy in the secondary prevention of carcinoma of the colon and rectum.

Aerosol models of filovirus infection have been developed in knock-out mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates; however, filovirus infection of immunocompetent mice by the aerosol route has not been reported. A murine model of aerosolized filovirus infection in mice should be useful for screening vaccine candidates and therapies. In this study, various strains of wild-type and immunocompromised mice were exposed to aerosolized wild-type (WT) or mouse-adapted (MA) Ebola virus (EBOV). Upon exposure to aerosolized WT-EBOV, BALB/c, C57BL/6 (B6), and DBA/2 (D2) mice were unaffected, but 100% of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and 90% of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat1) knock-out (KO) mice became moribund between 7-9 days post-exposure (dpe). Exposure to MA-EBOV caused 15% body weight loss in BALB/c, but all mice recovered. In contrast, 10-30% lethality was observed in B6 and D2 mice exposed to aerosolized MA-EBOV, and 100% of SCID, Stat1 KO, interferon (IFN)-γ KO and Perforin KO mice became moribund between 7-14 dpe. In order to identify wild-type, inbred, mouse strains in which exposure to aerosolized MA-EBOV is uniformly lethal, 60 BXD (C57BL/6 crossed with DBA/2) recombinant inbred (RI) and advanced RI (ARI) mouse strains were exposed to aerosolized MA-EBOV, and monitored for disease severity. A complete spectrum of disease severity was observed. All BXD strains lost weight but many recovered. However, infection was uniformly lethal within 7 to 12 days post-exposure in five BXD strains. Aerosol exposure of these five BXD strains to 10-fold less MA-EBOV resulted in lethality ranging from 0% in two strains to 90-100% lethality in two strains. Analysis of post-mortem tissue from BXD strains that became moribund and were euthanized at the lower dose of MA-EBOV, showed liver damage in all mice as well as lung lesions in two of the three strains. The two BXD strains that exhibited 90-100% mortality, even at a low dose of airborne MA-EBOV will be useful mouse models for testing vaccines and therapies. Additionally, since disease susceptibility is affected by complex genetic traits, a systems genetics approach was used to identify preliminary gene loci modulating disease severity among the panel BXD strains. Preliminary quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified that are likely to harbor genes involved in modulating differential susceptibility to Ebola infection. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/development-murine-model-aerosolized-ebolavirus-infection-using-panel-recombinant-inbred-mice-2"},{"title":"Inflammatory signaling and aryl hydrocarbon receptor mediate synergistic induction of interleukin 6 in MCF-7 cells","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"B.D.","last_name":"Hollingshead"},{"first_name":"T.V.","last_name":"Beischlag"},{"first_name":"B.C.","last_name":"DiNatale"},{"first_name":"P.","last_name":"Ramadoss"},{"first_name":"G.H.","last_name":"Perdew"}],"year":2008,"source":"Cancer research","identifiers":{"doi":"10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6168.Inflammatory"},"pages":"3609","volume":"68","issue":"10","websites":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/10/3609"],"publisher":"AACR","id":"e7352629-9171-36ee-bcb9-837043cf19c6","abstract":"The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) is involved in immune cell homeostasis. Additionally, IL-6 expression and signaling in tumor cells have been shown to elicit both protumor and antitumor properties. There is a plethora of mechanistic knowledge regarding how IL-6 signal transduction translates to biological responses. However, there is little understanding as to what factors control IL-6 expression within a tumor cell environment. The studies presented herein show that, in MCF-7 breast and ECC-1 endocervical cancer cells, the stimulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activity, in combination with IL-1B or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment, results in a marked synergistic induction of IL-6 levels over what is seen without AHR activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the regulation of IL-6 mRNA expression occurs at the chromatin level, as AHR presence on the IL-6 promoter was observed in response to treatment with AHR ligand. Synergistic induction of IL-6 expression was sustained for 72 hours, with accumulation of IL-6 protein reaching levels 4.8-fold above IL-1B treatment alone. In addition, transcriptional regulation of the prototypic AHR responsive gene Cyp1a1 was negatively regulated by PMA and IL-1B treatment. Silencing of RELA expression alleviated IL-1B–mediated repression of AHR transcriptional activity, whereas PMA-mediated repression was maintained. Additionally, small interfering RNA studies reveal that AHR and RELA are necessary for synergistic induction of IL-6. The findings presented here reveal the AHR as a potential therapeutic target for selective modulation of IL-6 expression in some tumor cell types. The data also suggest a possible previously unrecognized mechanism of AHR-mediated tumor promotion.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/inflammatory-signaling-aryl-hydrocarbon-receptor-mediate-synergistic-induction-interleukin-6-mcf7-ce"},{"title":"Druck auf die \"Times\"","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Gerti","last_name":"Schön"}],"year":2008,"source":"Zeitungskrise und aggressive Investoren setzen den  US-Traditionsverlagen zu","identifiers":{"issn":"0175-7989"},"keywords":["Presse nach Sparte-Zeitung","Werbung-Internet-allgemein","Werbung-Werbeeinnahmen"],"pages":"31","issue":"18","websites":["https://www.wiso-net.de/document/HOR__050802195"],"id":"54a7da15-f059-3836-9049-a6f1322a4f59","abstract":"Ungemütliche Zeiten für die \"New York Times\": Nach massiven Kursverlusten fordern die Aktionäre Sparprogramme und neue Strategien.

SAGES and the American College of Surgeons already have defined guidelines that, if properly implemented, could eliminate most of these challenges. Medical educators must formulate a detailed program as to how these guidelines can be widely deployed with acceptable effectiveness. The current educational philosophies and techniques will not ensure widespread access to a standardized program that would support the achievement of the goals set forth by major surgical governing bodies. Therefore, new educational strategies and techniques that are assisted with the integration of cost-effective technology are needed. Suggested solutions include the deployment of a standardized, objective-based skill-development program that has a large database to evaluate the progress of participants. Next, the Internet, with its ability to transfer content with the click of a mouse, will play an increasing role in distant education. Video and audio streaming techniques will allow the deployment of content previously shackled to a CD-ROM platform. CD-ROM interactive technology also can help in developing clinical judgment with innovative strategies, such as Objective-Based Clinical Competency Evaluation Scenarios. Telecommunications will fuse the components of a coordinated distant learning strategy. Also, telecommunications will allow the availability of new training capabilities in the form of teleproctoring and telementoring to hospitals, no matter what their size or location. All of these components combined enable the realization of a continuing education program in minimally invasive surgery that is readily available to hospitals worldwide. Last, institutions, resident training programs, and individual surgeons must commit the time to partake in these cutting-edge programs for challenges facing us to be completely eliminated. A high priority must be placed on the resolution of these issues.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/minimally-invasive-surgical-training-solutions-twentyfirst-century-7"},{"title":"Association between Body Mass Index and Infertility: A cross sectional study","type":"web_page","authors":[{"first_name":"and Reddy KK","last_name":"Sudha G, Reddy KSN"}],"year":2009,"source":"Asia Specific journal of Social Sciences","pages":"73 - 81","websites":["http://www.isaps-india.org/APJSS/5 K.S.

Both propofol and volatile anaesthetics have been shown to reduce reactive oxygen species in experimental and clinical studies. MAIN OBJECTIVE: To compare the influence of sevoflurane and propofol on myocardial oxidative stress markers (F2-isoprostanes and nitrates/nitrites) in coronary sinus blood samples from patients undergoing off-pump CABG. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomised controlled clinical study of patients scheduled for off-pump CABG in a tertiary academic university hospital from June 2007 to August 2009. Forty patients consented to enrolment and were assigned to receive either propofol or sevoflurane. INTERVENTIONS: Upon completion of the proximal anastomosis, a retroplegia cannula was inserted in the coronary sinus to obtain blood samples, according to the study protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Markers of lipoperoxidation (F2-isoprostanes) and nitrosative stress (nitrates/nitrites) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples at three time points: after the end of the proximal anastomosis (T1), after completion of all grafts (T2) and 15 min after revascularisation (T3). RESULTS: Of the 40 recruited patients, 38 fully completed the study. In the sevoflurane group (n = 20), concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the coronary sinus remained almost constant and were significantly lower than those in the propofol group (n = 18) at all time points. F2-isoprostanes concentrations were as follows at T1: sevoflurane group 37.2 +/- 27.5 pg ml vs. propofol group 170.7 +/- 30.9 pg ml [95% confidence interval (CI) 112.16-155.08, P < 0.0001); at T2: sevoflurane group 31.94 +/- 24.6 pg ml vs. propofol group 171.6 +/- 29.7 pg ml (95% CI 119.78-159.63, P < 0.0001); and at T3: sevoflurane group 23.8 +/- 13.0 pg ml vs. propofol group 43.6 +/- 31 pg ml (95% CI 2.87-36.63, P = 0.023).

Therefore, the significance of the riparian transpiration process, due to the continuously increasing demand for integrated sustainable water resources management policies, deserves great attention. It is for this reason that the present work was evoked to research the riparian groundwater dependency and consumptive groundwater use by the streamside flora. Observations of the daily groundwater multiple hydrographs, in conjunction with average daily temperature and solar radiation, indicated that the groundwater fluctuations were due to water losses from the riparian flora. The Diospyros lycioides (shrub) and Acacia karroo (tree) communities were found to be the two dominant riparian species along the subject area. However, the results indicated that only the Acacia karroo sourced their water primarily from the groundwater storage because: 1) the isotopic signature of twig xylem water was similar to that of groundwater and 2) the rooting depth was at the water table. This species was found to abstract approximately 121,100 m3/month from the riparian groundwater. This is considerably a voluminous abstraction which is most likely to pose a problem of water competition; therefore, groundwater dependency of the riverine flora must be considered in the formulation of any integrated sustainable water resources management policies in the subject area and/or similar areas for the co-existence of human society and nature.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/mapping-riparian-vegetation-charactersing-groundwater-dependency-modder-river-government-water-schem"},{"title":"Thermal loading in multi-layered and/or functionally graded materials: Residual stress field, delamination, fatigue and related size effects","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"Carpinteri","scopus_author_id":"14008431800"},{"first_name":"Nicola","last_name":"Pugno","scopus_author_id":"6701528077"}],"year":2006,"source":"International Journal of Solids and Structures","identifiers":{"pii":"S0020768305002611","sgr":"28244489372","scopus":"2-s2.0-28244489372","pui":"41705855","isbn":"0020-7683","issn":"00207683","doi":"10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2005.05.009"},"keywords":["Delamination","Functionally graded materials","Residual stresses","Size-effects","Thermal loading"],"pages":"828-841","volume":"43","issue":"3-4","month":2,"id":"90f6d95b-d29b-3be4-9df5-2f4fe87edc88","abstract":"The stress field and fracture propagation due to thermal loading in multi-layered and/or functionally graded composite materials are extensively analysed.

This study portrays the immunostaining of c-Met in endometrial neoplasms, and assesses its value as diagnostic and prognostic marker. Methods: This study retrospectively recruited 102 cases that include 72 and 30 cases of malignant and benign endometrial tissues respectively. These cases were retrieved from the archives of Pathology Department at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Tissue microarrays and immunostaining were used to show the phenotype of c-met. Results: A total number of 13 (18.05%) tumor cases were positive for c-met immunostaining. Yalow to brown cytoplasmic and/or membranous expression of c-met was detected in 2/9 (22.2%) of papillary serous endometrial carcinomas, 9/53 (17%) of endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and one case of each endometrial stromal sarcoma and malignant mixed Mullerian tumor. Twenty three (76.6%) control cases showed positive immunostaining. c-Met immunostaining was common in the cytoplasm more than membranes in malignant tumors while it was cytoplasmic and membranous in benign tissues. Significant different c-Met immunostaining distribution was observed between tumor cases and control group (P-Value = 0.0000). Furthermore, inverse odds ratio shows that tumor cases are 14.92 times less likely of having positive c-Met immunostaining (odds ratio 0.067 with 95% confidence interval 0.024-0.189). This study did not find relation between c-Met expression and disease recurrence, survival or any of the other clinicopathological parameters in endometrial tumors. Conclusion: This study in favor of c-Met expression is not a valuable factor for tumor development, recurrence, and survival in endometrial tumors. Greater c-Met staining was seen in normal and benign endometrial tissue compared to endometrial carcinomas. Loss of c-Met expression gives an indication for endometrial tumors.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/loss-cmet-expression-malignant-endometrial-tumors-immunohistochemistry-study"},{"title":"[The effect of alcohol on life- and health-threatening punishable offenses and their prevention].","type":"generic","authors":[{"first_name":"M","last_name":"Mitlohner"}],"year":1989,"source":"K vlivu alkoholu na trestne ciny proti zivotu a zdravi a jejich prevenci.","identifiers":{"isbn":"0009-0689"},"keywords":["*Alcoholic Intoxication","*Crime","Alcoholic Intoxication/pc [Prevention & Control]","Crime/pc [Prevention & Control]","Crime/td [Trends]","Czechoslovakia","Homicide","Humans","Violence"],"pages":"293-298","volume":"37","issue":"6-7","websites":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=2791114"],"city":"CZECHOSLOVAKIA","id":"d9e23561-5926-3c81-be18-e08061ec85a9","abstract":"The combination of drinking and abuse of alcoholic beverages with different types of deviant behaviour must be investigated as one of the factors which may hasten this type of activity.

Based on the favorable results of our prospective phase II study of mFOLFIRINOX in locally advanced PC (Stein SM et al. Br J Cancer. 2016), we are conducting a single arm open-label phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative mFOLFIRINOX in resectable PC. Here we report our interim results. Methods: Pts with untreated resectable PC were treated with 6 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX every 2 weeks before and after surgical resection. Pre-op FDG-PET and CT scans were obtained at baseline and after 3 and 6 cycles, respectively. After study treatment pts were followed with serial CT scans and CA 19-9 levels. We performed our validated test for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at baseline and multiple time points thereafter. Results: At our interim analysis, 19 pts are enrolled; 1 pt withdrew consent after 1 cycle and is not included. Baseline characteristics: median age 64; male 12; median CA-19 94 (range 0.8-1926); head of pancreas tumor 14; biliary stent 9; ECOG 0 17. Two pts received < 6 cycles pre-op for reasons other than progression or treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Response by RECIST for the 17 pts who received ≤ 3 pre-op cycles was: CR/PR 1 (6%), SD 15 (88%) (8 with minor response defined as 10-30% decrease in target lesion), and PD 1 (6%). Six of 14 pts (43%) who received FDG-PET scans had > 50% decrease in SUV. At present, 2 pts have yet to complete 6 pre-op cycles. Fifteen pts have undergone surgical exploration, and 2 were not deemed resectable during exploration due to peritoneal implants and adhesions from chronic pancreatitis. Thirteen of 16 (82%) underwent resection; 12 (92%) were R0; 2 (15%), 5 (39%), and 6 (46%) pts had pathologic stage I, IIA, and IIB disease, respectively. 4 pts developed disease recurrence and died. AEs were not different than we previously reported and were manageable with protocol-mandated dose adjustments. Conclusions: Our interim analysis suggests that perioperative mFOLFIRINOX for resectable PC is feasible and associated with a 92% rate of R0 resection. Accrual will continue to 46 pts, and analysis of efficacy endpoints and correlative studies including ctDNA are ongoing.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/interim-analysis-perioperative-modified-folfirinox-mfolfirinox-resectable-pancreatic-cancer-pc"},{"title":"Use of prostate specific antigen to measure bladder tumor growth in a mouse orthotopic model","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Luo","last_name":"Y."},{"first_name":"Chen","last_name":"X."},{"first_name":"O'Donnell","last_name":"M.A."}],"year":2004,"source":"Journal of Urology","identifiers":{"issn":"0022-5347","doi":"10.1097/01.ju.0000143860.50878.b1"},"keywords":["animal cell","antigen expression","article","bladder cancer","controlled study","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","female","gemcitabine","immunofluorescence","mitomycin","mouse","nonhuman","priority journal","prostate specific antigen","tumor growth","tumor marker","tumor model"],"pages":"2414-2420","volume":"172","issue":"6 I","websites":["http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L39507546\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ju.0000143860.50878.b1"],"id":"90f6dd22-72b7-3ce9-9688-90edada279f1","abstract":"Purpose: Animal orthotopic tumor models are commonly used in bladder cancer studies. However, to our knowledge there is currently no accurate method to quantify tumor growth inside the bladder in living animals. We used prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a marker to cope with this limitation. Materials and Methods: Infectious but replication incompetent retroviral particles carrying PSA coding sequence were constructed and infected into MB49 cells, a mouse bladder transitional cell carcinoma line of C57BL/6 origin. Syngeneic mice were intravesically implanted with the novel MB49-PSA transfectants. Tumor burden was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurement for PSA in urine and bladder tissues. Results: The MB49-PSA line actively secreted PSA in culture as well as in urine (18 to 2,062 pg/ml) depending on tumor mass. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed PSA expression in MB49-PSA derived orthotopic tumors. Urinary PSA production paralleled tumor growth and was detectable prior to the development of a palpable tumor. Although urinary PSA did not tightly correlate with tumor mass, all bladders (total of 16 tested) weighing 34 mg or greater (18 to 21 mg for age and sex matched normal bladders) showed 18 pg/ml or greater urinary PSA. In contrast, bladder tissue PSA correlated more with tumor mass in general and it was measurable even before the detection of urinary PSA. This MB49-PSA orthotopic tumor model also demonstrated its usefulness for evaluating the antibladder cancer agents gemcitabine and mitomycin. Conclusions: This novel MB49-PSA line may serve as a useful tool for bladder cancer study because its growth inside the bladder can be noninvasively measured in living animals even during early stages of tumor growth.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/prostate-specific-antigen-measure-bladder-tumor-growth-mouse-orthotopic-model-1"},{"title":"Behavioural audiograms from the bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Glenis R.","last_name":"Long","scopus_author_id":"57197435380"},{"first_name":"Hans Ulrich","last_name":"Schnitzler","scopus_author_id":"7003615620"}],"year":1975,"source":"Journal of Comparative Physiology ■ A","identifiers":{"sgr":"34250409505","scopus":"2-s2.0-34250409505","pui":"205005499","issn":"03407594","doi":"10.1007/BF00614531"},"pages":"211-219","volume":"100","issue":"3","month":1,"publisher":"Springer-Verlag","id":"9abb2802-4991-3dcd-9ac8-5a87edda5f9b","abstract":"A conditioned heart rate and muscular activity response was used to measure behavioural audiograms in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum .

The method improves the predictable ability forthe average performance and the temporal behavior of real-time control systems.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/%EC%8B%A4%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%84-%EC%A0%9C%EC%96%B4%EC%8B%9C%EC%8A%A4%ED%85%9C%EC%9D%98-%ED%99%95%EB%A5%A0%EC%A0%81-%EC%9D%91%EB%8B%B5%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%84-%ED%95%B4%EC%84%9D%EC%97%90-%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C-%EC%97%B0%EA%B5%AC-study-probabilistic-responsetime-analysis-realtime-control-systems"},{"title":"Specific recognition and killing of glioblastoma multiforme by 13-zetakine redirected cytolytic T cells","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"K S","last_name":"Kahlon"},{"first_name":"K S","last_name":"Kahlon"},{"first_name":"C","last_name":"Brown"},{"first_name":"C","last_name":"Brown"},{"first_name":"L J","last_name":"Cooper"},{"first_name":"L J","last_name":"Cooper"},{"first_name":"a","last_name":"Raubitschek"},{"first_name":"a","last_name":"Raubitschek"},{"first_name":"S J","last_name":"Forman"},{"first_name":"S J","last_name":"Forman"},{"first_name":"M C","last_name":"Jensen"},{"first_name":"M C","last_name":"Jensen"}],"year":2004,"source":"Cancer Res","identifiers":{"pmid":"15604287","isbn":"0008-5472 (Print)\\r0008-5472 (Linking)","issn":"00085472","doi":"10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0454"},"keywords":["Animals","Brain Neoplasms/immunology/ therapy","Cell Line, Tumor","DNA, Complementary/genetics","Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/ immunology","Glioblastoma/immunology/ therapy","Humans","Immunotherapy, Adoptive/ methods","Interleukin-13/genetics/ immunology/metabolism","Lymphocyte Activation","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred NOD","Mice, SCID","Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/immunology","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/ immunology/physiology","Transfection","Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"],"pages":"9160-9166","volume":"64","issue":"24","id":"90f6e08a-4921-3331-a2d0-e1a61b74e1d6","abstract":"The interleukin (IL) 13 receptor alpha2 (IL13Ralpha2) is a glioma-restricted cell-surface epitope not otherwise detected within the central nervous system. Here, we describe a novel approach for targeting glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with IL13Ralpha2-specific cytolytic T (CTLs) by their genetic modification to express a membrane-tethered IL13 cytokine chimeric T-cell antigen receptor, or zetakine. Our prototype zetakine incorporates an IL13 E13Y mutein for selective binding to IL13Ralpha2. Human IL13-zetakine(+)CD8(+) CTL transfectants display IL13Ralpha2-specific antitumor effector function including tumor cell cytolysis, T(C)1 cytokine production, and zetakine-regulated autocrine proliferation. The E13Y amino acid substitution of the IL13 mutein of zetakine endows CTL transfectants with the capacity to discriminate between IL13Ralpha2(+) GBM targets from targets expressing IL13Ralpha1. vivo, the adoptive transfer of IL13-zetakine(+)CD8(+) CTL clones results in the regression of established human glioblastoma orthotopic Pilot clinical trials have been initiated to evaluate the feasibility safety of local-regional delivery of autologous IL13-zetakine redirected CTL clones in patients with recurrent GBM.

Alveolar recruitment followed by ventilation at optimal titrated PEEP may reduce ventilator-induced lung injury and improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS, but the effects on mortality and other clinical outcomes remain unknown. This article reports the rationale, study design, and analysis plan of the Alveolar Recruitment for ARDS Trial (ART). METHODS/DESIGN: ART is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized (concealed), controlled trial, which aims to determine if maximum stepwise alveolar recruitment associated with PEEP titration is able to increase 28-day survival in patients with ARDS compared to conventional treatment (ARDSNet strategy). We will enroll adult patients with ARDS of less than 72 h duration. The intervention group will receive an alveolar recruitment maneuver, with stepwise increases of PEEP achieving 45 cmH2O and peak pressure of 60 cmH2O, followed by ventilation with optimal PEEP titrated according to the static compliance of the respiratory system. In the control group, mechanical ventilation will follow a conventional protocol (ARDSNet). In both groups, we will use controlled volume mode with low tidal volumes (4 to 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight) and targeting plateau pressure </=30 cmH2O. The primary outcome is 28-day survival, and the secondary outcomes are: length of ICU stay; length of hospital stay; pneumothorax requiring chest tube during first 7 days; barotrauma during first 7 days; mechanical ventilation-free days from days 1 to 28; ICU, in-hospital, and 6-month survival. ART is an event-guided trial planned to last until 520 events (deaths within 28 days) are observed. These events allow detection of a hazard ratio of 0.75, with 90% power and two-tailed type I error of 5%. All analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: If the ART strategy with maximum recruitment and PEEP titration improves 28-day survival, this will represent a notable advance to the care of ARDS patients. Conversely, if the ART strategy is similar or inferior to the current evidence-based strategy (ARDSNet), this should also change current practice as many institutions routinely employ recruitment maneuvers and set PEEP levels according to some titration method.

Consequently, this paper presents a systematic model for the efficient design of working fluids and the optimization of cycle parameters at the molecular scale, so that optimal working fluids can be identified by simultaneously considering cycle parameters, environmental and safety properties. In the proposed model, working fluids are generated via the combination of groups. The required properties, which consist of thermodynamic, environmental and safety properties, are estimated by the published group contribution methods. Based on these estimated properties, cycle optimizations are performed to obtain the optimal performance of working fluids using an ORC model. Thereafter, optimal working fluids are identified, according to the cycle parameters, environmental and safety properties. Furthermore, working fluids design and cycle optimization for an example are conducted to demonstrate the proposed model. The optimal candidates, namely R254eb, R254cb, are found for the considered example through proposed methodology. The novel working fluids, which are firstly reported in ORC applications, are worth being studied in-depth through time-consuming and expensive experiments.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/simultaneous-working-fluids-design-cycle-optimization-organic-rankine-cycle-using-group-contribution"},{"title":"Exact equation of motion for a dislocation in a two-dimensional lattice","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"T.","last_name":"Munakata","scopus_author_id":"7102982383"},{"first_name":"A.","last_name":"Igarashi","scopus_author_id":"7101830568"}],"year":1992,"source":"Physical Review B","identifiers":{"sgr":"4244204774","scopus":"2-s2.0-4244204774","pui":"222138723","issn":"01631829","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.46.13786"},"pages":"13786-13791","volume":"46","issue":"21","id":"d9e2420f-57db-3c57-8ada-1fe7838f4452","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/exact-equation-motion-dislocation-twodimensional-lattice"},{"title":"Structural studies of 2,2' - bipyridine on Au(100)","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Th","last_name":"Dretschkow"},{"first_name":"Th","last_name":"Wandlowski"}],"year":1999,"source":"Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry","identifiers":{"issn":"1572-6657","pmid":"ISI:000082614000023"},"keywords":["Abstract"],"pages":"207-216","volume":"467","id":"90f6e651-8cab-3aa6-9f3a-42761286f21c","abstract":"The adsorption of 2,2'-bipyridine (2,2'-BP) on Au(100) in acidic soln. was investigated by electrochem. methods and in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).
