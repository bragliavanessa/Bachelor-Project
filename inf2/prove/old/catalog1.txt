The aim of the work was to find about the subject to what extent patients understand the subject and how many of them have such a preventive document. The area of research has been examined on the basis of a standardized questionnaire drawn up by means of anonymous data collection in the quantitative research design. After the pretest, the survey was done in form of a documented Face-to-face-questioning in the HELIOS hospital Leisnig. The sample size comprised 139 patients from which 84 patients (37 female, 47 male) agreed with the survey. 25 percent of the questioned patients knew the law of living will (Patientenverfügungsgesetz) and 27 percent knew about the content of preventive instruments. 46.4 percent of the surveyed patients, aged between 70 and 75, had at least one preventive instrument. 63.1 percent of the patients believed that a living will has to be in a written form. 21.4 percent said that, in addition, the document has to be authenticated by a notary public. A study by van Oorschot claims that between ten and 15 percent of the people living in Germany have a living will (van Oorschot 2008, p. 443, Sahm & Schroeder 2009, p. 98). The results of this study show a much higher proportion of existing living wills. For the majority of respondents a preventive instrument plays still a minor role, but 46 percent of the population already use a preventive instrument to make provisions for themselves. 27 percent did express their will in theform of a living will.

The method is implemented within an automatic differentiation-based compositional flow simulator (Stanford's Automatic Differentiation-based General Purpose Research Simulator, AD-GPRS). The development of adjoint procedures for general compositional problems is much more challenging than for oil-water problems due to the increased complexity of the code and the underlying physics. The treatment of nonlinear constraints, an example of which is a maximum gas rate specification in injection or production wells, when the control variables are well bottom-hole pressures, poses a particular challenge. Two approaches for handling these constraints are presented-a formal treatment within the optimizer and a simpler heuristic treatment in the forward model. The relationship between discrete and continuous adjoint formulations is also elucidated. Results for four example cases of increasing complexity are presented. Improvements in the objective function (cumulative oil produced) relative to reference solutions range from 4.2 to 11.6 %.

The solutions produced using these CAD systems are undoubtedly valuable from the point of view of applicability in sheet metal forming practice. However, this approach is time consuming and most of the design time is spent within these CAD systems. This paper presents the development of a computer-based approach for the evolutionary automatic design (EAD) of geometry and process parameters for industrial metal forming processes. The main characteristics of the solution methodology are the use of evolution strategies within the optimizer, the use of sheet metal formability as objective functions and a parameterization of die surfaces. The results of a comparative study of our EAD die surface generation against conventional CAD die surface generation for a representative structural design problem show the efficiency of the former. It is observed that EAD often finds the region of the search space containing the global optimum, thus supporting engineers in practice with automatic generated sheet metal forming tools. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The former increases the block-diagonal dominance of the system, whereas the latter controls $\\|L^{-1}\\|$ for numerical stability. When applied recursively, their combined effect yields an algebraic coarsening strategy, similar to algebraic multigrid methods, even for highly indefinite matrices.

The numerical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the ML preconditioner, even at higher frequency regimes.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/algebraic-multilevel-preconditioner-helmholtz-equation-heterogeneous-media"},{"title":"Algorithmic performance studies on graphics processing units","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"6701544373"},{"first_name":"Matthias","last_name":"Christen","scopus_author_id":"55225332000"},{"first_name":"Helmar","last_name":"Burkhart","scopus_author_id":"7005750160"}],"year":2008,"source":"Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing","identifiers":{"scopus":"2-s2.0-51449090534","issn":"07437315","pui":"50230868","pii":"S0743731508000920","sgr":"51449090534","doi":"10.1016/j.jpdc.2008.05.008"},"keywords":["Graphics processing units","Matrix decomposition","Nonlinear optimization","Parallel processing","Sparse direct solvers"],"pages":"1360-1369","volume":"68","issue":"10","month":10,"id":"26929ab7-563c-3a7b-8c18-03f93ed7a6d7","abstract":"We report on our experience with integrating and using graphics processing units (GPUs) as fast parallel floating-point co-processors to accelerate two fundamental computational scientific kernels on the GPU: sparse direct factorization and nonlinear interior-point optimization.

Häufig ist diese Entwicklung jedoch mit einer zunehmenden Belastung für die gesamte Familie, insbesondere für die Eltern, verbunden. Anhand einer umfangreichen Literaturarbeit wird daher die Not-wendigkeit der psychosozialen Begleitung von Eltern in der Neo-natologie herausgestellt. Methodik In den Datenbanken Pubmed, Psyndex, CINAHl und medpilot wurde zunächst eine systematische Literaturrecher-che durchgeführt. Um weitere relevante Publikationen zu fin-den, wurden außerdem die Referenzlisten der gefundenen Artikel überprüft. Eine anschließende Freitextsuche hatte die Ergänzung der Schlagwortsuche zum Ziel. Insgesamt konnten auf diese Weise 78 Veröffentlichungen aus den Jahren von 1975 bis 2015 in die Studie einbezogen werden. Ergebnisse Die Bedeutung der psychosozialen Begleitung von Eltern in der Neonatologie lässt sich anhand der ausgewerteten Fachliteratur eindrucksvoll belegen. Allerdings fällt auf, dass die Notwendigkeit eines Assessments als Grundlage einer den indivi-duellen Bedürfnissen der Familie entsprechenden Begleitung zwar bekannt ist, die Verwendung von validierten Screeninginstrumen-ten offenbar jedoch noch nicht zum Standard gehört. Ferner wird deutlich, dass der Bedarf an psychosozialer Unterstützung seitens der Eltern nicht allein vom medizinischen Risiko des Kindes abhängt. Schlussfolgerungen Die vorliegenden Erkenntnisse implizie-ren insbesondere die Herausforderung, unter Berücksichtigung der in der Entwicklung befindlichen Eltern-Kind-Einheit, in ei-nem Gesundheitssystem mit eingeschränkten Ressourcen und vor dem Hintergrund gesundheitsökonomischer Vorgaben, dennoch eine hoch individuelle Betreuung betroffener Familien möglich zu machen. Mitunter intuitiv ausgebildete Konzepte sollten in Zukunft weiter wissenschaftlich fundiert werden.

At the core of these methods, highly ill-conditioned symmetric saddle-point problems have to be solved. We present combinatorial methods to preprocess these matrices in order to establish more favorable numerical properties for the subsequent factorization. Our approach is based on symmetric weighted matchings and is used in a sparse direct LDLT factorization method where the pivoting is restricted to static supernode data structures. In addition, we will dynamically expand the supernode data structure in cases where additional fill-in helps to select better numerical pivot elements.

In complex acoustic or elastic media, finite element meshes often require regions of refinement to honour external or internal topography, or small-scale features. These localized smaller elements create a bottleneck for explicit time-stepping schemes due to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition. Recently developed local time stepping (LTS) algorithms reduce the impact of these small elements by locally adapting the time-step size to the size of the element. The recursive, multi-level nature of our LTS scheme introduces an additional challenge, as standard partitioning schemes create a strong load imbalance across processors. We examine the use of multi-constraint graph and hypergraph partitioning tools to achieve effective, load-balanced parallelization. We implement LTS-Newmark in the seismology code SPECFEM3D and compare performance and scalability between different partitioning tools on CPU and GPU clusters using examples from computational seismology.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/loadbalanced-local-time-stepping-largescale-wave-propagation"},{"title":"Enhancing the scalability of selected inversion factorization algorithms in genomic prediction","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Fabio","last_name":"Verbosio","scopus_author_id":"57039974800"},{"first_name":"Arne","last_name":"De Coninck","scopus_author_id":"56269781900"},{"first_name":"Drosos","last_name":"Kourounis","scopus_author_id":"15735165800"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"6701544373"}],"year":2017,"source":"Journal of Computational Science","identifiers":{"pii":"S1877750317301473","sgr":"85029603025","scopus":"2-s2.0-85029603025","pui":"618336636","issn":"18777503","doi":"10.1016/j.jocs.2017.08.013"},"keywords":["Distributed-memory computation","Genomic prediction","Parallel computation","Schur-complement decomposition","Selected inversion"],"pages":"99-108","volume":"22","month":9,"publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","day":1,"id":"1b37bca5-619e-3240-adea-906661270bf2","abstract":"A parallel distributed-memory approach for the exact calculation of selected entries of the inverse of a matrix arising in a Best Linear Unbiased Estimation (BLUE) problem in genomic prediction is presented.

The construct contained the FLP recombinase under control of a heat inducible promoter, the antibiotic resistance gene nptII driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, and a promoterless uidA gene. The construct was integrated into poplar via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The active FLP recombinase excised the nptII marker gene and combined the promoterless uidA gene with the CaMV 35S promoter to form an active uidA gene. For targeted transgene integration, two constructs were used. The first one carried FLP under control of the heat-inducible Gmhsp17.5-E promoter from soybean as well as an active nptII gene flanked by two FRT sites; the second contained the promoterless bar selection marker gene also flanked by two FRT sites. Following transformation and induction of FLP, the enzyme mediated a site-specific recombination at the FRT sites of both constructs. This recombination leads to an excision of the FLP and nptII gene from the first as well as an excision of the promoterless bar gene from the second construct. The promoterless bar gene reintegrated exactly at the former position of the FLP and nptII genes in the first construct to form an active bar gene. The FLP/FRT recombination system from yeast forms a promising basis for the production of antibiotic-free transgenic plants and a useful tool for directed integration of transgenes into plant genomes.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/elimination-marker-genes-targeted-integration-via-flpfrt-recombination-system-yeast-hybrid-aspen-pop"},{"title":"Scalable high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic modeling","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Johannes","last_name":"Brumm","scopus_author_id":"55911085300"},{"first_name":"Dmitry","last_name":"Mikushin","scopus_author_id":"36195087800"},{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Scheidegger","scopus_author_id":"36057190000"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"6701544373"}],"year":2015,"source":"Journal of Computational Science","identifiers":{"pii":"S1877750315300053","sgr":"84940492592","scopus":"2-s2.0-84940492592","pui":"605829000","issn":"18777503","doi":"10.1016/j.jocs.2015.07.004"},"keywords":["Adaptive sparse grids","Heterogeneous systems","High-dimensional grids","High-performance computing","International real business cycles","Parallel algorithms"],"pages":"12-25","volume":"11","month":11,"publisher":"Elsevier","day":1,"id":"68346bdf-1c2d-31ef-8716-2232a71c4165","abstract":"We present a highly parallelizable and flexible computational method to solve high-dimensional stochastic dynamic economic models.

Coupling this parallel similarity algorithm with a parallel auction-based bipartite matching technique, we obtain a highly efficient and scalable graph matching pipeline. We validate the performance of our integrated approach on a large parallel platform and on diverse graph instances (including Protein Interaction, Wikipedia and Web networks).

Two de facto standards, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for programming distributed memory architectures and OpenMP for programming shared-memory architectures still dominate the field of computational science and engineering. As current supercomputers are constellations with symmetric multiprocessor nodes that are coupled by high-speed inter-connects such as Infiniband, hybrid versions OpenMP/MPI have been introduced. From the programmer’s point of view, this is rather complicated and the resulting software productivity is not at all comparable with corresponding practice of commercial software elsewhere. While today’s desktop computers are already parallel systems, this effect will be even more accentuated in the coming years. Extrapolation from the current TOP500 list tells us that a desktop or laptop computer will have more than 1000 processor elements in 10 years from now.

Steatosis, a common liver disease characterized by lipids accumulating in hepatocytes, exhibits heterogeneity at both these spatial scales. The main goal of the present study was to provide a method for zonated quantification of the steatosis patterns found in an entire mouse liver. As an example application, the results were employed in a pharmacokinetics simulation.For the analysis, an automatic detection of the lipid vacuoles was used in multiple slides of histological serial sections covering an entire mouse liver. Lobuli were determined semi-automatically and zones were defined within the lobuli. Subsequently, the lipid content of each zone was computed. The steatosis patterns were found to be predominantly periportal, with a notable organ-scale heterogeneity.The analysis provides a quantitative description of the extent of steatosis in unprecedented detail. The resulting steatosis patterns were successfully used as a perturbation to the liver as part of an exemplary whole-body pharmacokinetics simulation for the antitussive drug dextromethorphan. The zonated quantification is also applicable to other pathological conditions that can be detected in histological images. Besides being a descriptive research tool, this quantification could perspectively complement diagnosis based on visual assessment of histological images.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/zonated-quantification-steatosis-entire-mouse-liver"},{"title":"Towards parallel large-scale Genomic prediction by coupling sparse and dense matrix algebra","type":"conference_proceedings","authors":[{"first_name":"Arne","last_name":"De Coninck","scopus_author_id":"56269781900"},{"first_name":"Drosos","last_name":"Kourounis","scopus_author_id":"15735165800"},{"first_name":"Fabio","last_name":"Verbosio","scopus_author_id":"57039974800"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"6701544373"},{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"De Baets","scopus_author_id":"55664779600"},{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Maenhout","scopus_author_id":"22734778400"},{"first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Fostier","scopus_author_id":"15063921100"}],"year":2015,"source":"Proceedings - 23rd Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing, PDP 2015","identifiers":{"sgr":"84962812086","scopus":"2-s2.0-84962812086","pui":"609840958","isbn":"9781479984909","doi":"10.1109/PDP.2015.94"},"keywords":["Distributed computing","Genomic prediction","Plant breeding","Sparse matrix algebra"],"pages":"747-750","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","id":"214d416c-18e2-3bf0-a219-9f7b89ae10a2","abstract":"© 2015 IEEE. Genomic prediction for plant breeding requires taking into account environmental effects and variations of genetic effects across environments. The latter can be modelled by estimating the effect of each genetic marker in every possible environmental condition, which leads to a huge amount of effects to be estimated. Nonetheless, the information about these effects is only sparsely present, due to the fact that plants are only tested in a limited number of environmental conditions. In contrast, the genotypes of the plants are a dense source of information and thus the estimation of both types of effects in one single step would require as well dense as sparse matrix formalisms. This paper presents a way to efficiently apply a high performance computing infrastructure for dealing with large-scale genomic prediction settings, relying on the coupling of dense and sparse matrix algebra.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/towards-parallel-largescale-genomic-prediction-coupling-sparse-dense-matrix-algebra"},{"title":"A comparison of sampling strategies for histological image analysis.

To train these classifiers, the user must select samples of the relevant image objects. In the field of active learning, there has been much research on sampling strategies that exploit the uncertainty of the current classification in order to guide the user to maximally informative samples. Although these approaches have the potential to reduce the training effort and increase the classification accuracy, they are very rarely employed in practice. In this paper, we investigate the practical value of uncertainty sampling in the context of histological image analysis. To obtain practically meaningful results, we have devised an evaluation algorithm that simulates the way a human interacts with a user interface. The results show that uncertainty sampling outperforms common random or error sampling strategies by achieving more accurate classification results with a lower number of training images.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/comparison-sampling-strategies-histological-image-analysis-tl-2"},{"title":"Practical quantification of necrosis in histological whole-slide images","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"André","last_name":"Homeyer","scopus_author_id":"35746227600"},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"7005317789"},{"first_name":"Janine","last_name":"Arlt","scopus_author_id":"55766247400"},{"first_name":"Uta","last_name":"Dahmen","scopus_author_id":"55789262800"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Dirsch","scopus_author_id":"7004018031"},{"first_name":"Horst K.","last_name":"Hahn","scopus_author_id":"7402381436"}],"year":2013,"source":"Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics","identifiers":{"isbn":"1879-0771","scopus":"2-s2.0-84880712745","issn":"08956111","pui":"52644078","pii":"S0895611113000979","pmid":"23796718","arxiv":"arXiv:1011.1669v3","sgr":"84880712745","doi":"10.1016/j.compmedimag.2013.05.002"},"keywords":["Histological image analysis","Necrosis quantification","Pattern recognition","Whole-slide imaging"],"pages":"313-322","volume":"37","issue":"4","month":6,"id":"f888564b-c23a-3d89-a9df-ce236c47f78a","abstract":"Since the histological quantification of necrosis is a common task in medical research and practice, we evaluate different image analysis methods for quantifying necrosis in whole-slide images.

The relevance of factors besides the absolute liver mass is discussed controversially. It is the aim of this study to test the effect of two different mass ligation techniques in comparison with our newly developed parenchyma-preserving vessel-oriented liver resection technique on the induction of a SFSS after extended 90% liver resection in the rat. Materials and methods: Ninety percent liver resections were performed using three surgical techniques, two mass ligation techniques, and a vessel oriented technique. Diagnosis of SFSS was based on the combination of biochemical and morphological criteria on the first postoperative day and was related to the outcome on postoperative day 7 and the regenerative capacity of the liver. Results: Only the use of mass ligation techniques was associated with a low 1-wk survival rate (<40%), more pronounced histomorphological signs of liver damage at 24 h postoperatively, and a delayed onset of hepatocyte proliferation. Histological analysis revealed an extended stump necrosis in the paracaval liver and signs of sinusoidal damage in the remaining caudate lobes as morphological correlates of a putative outflow obstruction as the possible underlying reason. The lesions added up to a high small-for-size score in rats operated according to mass ligation techniques. Conclusions: These results indicate that preservation of functional liver mass and prevention of an outflow obstruction by delicate surgery is essential to prevent a SFSS in a size-reduced liver. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: We present a new method for the identification of fat droplets that utilizes adjacency statistics as shape features. Adjacency statistics are simple statistics on neighbor pixels. Results: The method accurately identified fat droplets with sensitivity and specificity values above 90%.

Recently, tagging has grown popular as an alternative means of organizing information resources. We argue that tagging is a powerful paradigm for efficient information access which overcomes many deficiencies of hierarchical file systems, especially in the context of the organization of large quantities of personal files. In this paper we present TagFS, a filesystem with tagging support which aims at a seamless integration of the tagging paradigm with local applications. While retaining the notions of directories and files and providing all standard filesystem operations, the semantics of these primitives are changed to modifications of the tag annotations.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/tagfs-tag-semantics-hierarchical-file-systems"},{"title":"Needles: Toward large-scale genomic prediction with marker-by-environment interaction","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Arne","last_name":"De Coninck","scopus_author_id":"56269781900"},{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"De Baets","scopus_author_id":"55664779600"},{"first_name":"Drosos","last_name":"Kourounis","scopus_author_id":"15735165800"},{"first_name":"Fabio","last_name":"Verbosio","scopus_author_id":"57039974800"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"6701544373"},{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"Maenhout","scopus_author_id":"22734778400"},{"first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Fostier","scopus_author_id":"15063921100"}],"year":2016,"source":"Genetics","identifiers":{"pmid":"26936924","sgr":"84979939204","scopus":"2-s2.0-84979939204","doi":"10.1534/genetics.115.179887","isbn":"0000000299","issn":"19432631","pui":"611511165"},"keywords":["GenPred","Genomic prediction","Genomic selection","High-performance computing","Marker-by-environment interaction","Shared data resource","Simulated data","Variance component estimation"],"pages":"543-555","volume":"203","issue":"1","month":5,"publisher":"Genetics","day":1,"id":"1c764859-a522-3414-a74e-2e1d5278c53e","abstract":"Genomic prediction relies on genotypic marker information to predict the agronomic performance of future hybrid breeds based on trial records. Since the effect of markers may vary substantially under the influence of different environmental conditions, marker-by-environment interaction effects have to be taken into account. However, this may lead to a dramatic increase of the computational resources needed for analyzing large-scale trial data. A high performance computing solution, called Needles, is presented for handling such data sets. Needles is tailored to the particular properties of the underlying algebraic framework by exploiting a sparse matrix formalism where suited and by utilizing distributed computing techniques to enable the use of a dedicated computing cluster. It is demonstrated that large-scale analyses can be performed within reasonable time frames with this framework. Moreover, by analyzing simulated trial data, it is shown that the effects of markers with a high environmental interaction can be predicted more accurately when more records per environment are available in the training data. The availability of such data and enabling their analysis with Needles may also lead to the discovery of highly contributing QTL in specific environmental conditions. Such a framework thus opens the path for plant breeders to select crops on these QTL, resulting in hybrid lines with optimized agronomic performance in specific environmental conditions.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/needles-toward-largescale-genomic-prediction-markerbyenvironment-interaction"},{"title":"A comparison of sampling strategies for histological image analysis","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"André","last_name":"Homeyer"},{"first_name":"Uta","last_name":"Dahmen"},{"first_name":"Hai","last_name":"Huang"},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Schenk"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Dirsch"},{"first_name":"HorstK","last_name":"Hahn"}],"year":2011,"source":"Journal of Pathology Informatics","identifiers":{"issn":"2153-3539","doi":"10.4103/2153-3539.92034","isbn":"2153-3539 (Electronic)","pmid":"22811955"},"pages":"11","volume":"2","issue":"2","websites":["http://www.jpathinformatics.org/text.asp?2011/2/2/11/92034"],"id":"d1963c04-61da-3845-af04-2b6b75b73d66","abstract":"Histological image analysis methods often employ machine-learning classifiers in order to adapt to the huge variability of histological images.

This leads to focal outflow obstruction in the remnant liver or the partial graft. This study was designed to characterize the pathophysiological correlate of focal outflow obstruction in a small-for-size liver and its course of recovery in a rat model.\\n\\nMETHODS: Ligation of the right median hepatic vein was combined with 50% hepatectomy. Microcirculation was visualized by orthogonal polarization spectroscopy after each operative step and before killing on days 1, 2, and 7. Histologic evaluation included morphological assessment, immunohistochemical determination of proliferation using BrdU, and laminin and von Willebrand factor expression, which both indicate vascularization of sinusoids.\\n\\nRESULTS: After ligation of the right median hepatic vein, congestion was visible and no sinusoidal blood flow was detected in the obstruction zone. By day 1 confluent centrilobular necrosis developed. Sinusoidal perfusion in the obstruction zone recovered partially. Many dilated vascularized sinusoidal canals connecting the obstruction zone with the normal zone were visible. Proliferative activity in the obstruction zone was markedly reduced compared with the normal zone. By day 7, liver parenchyma in the obstruction zone looked normal as did sinusoidal perfusion. In the border zone, few dilated vascular canals were apparent.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Confluent centrilobular necrosis in the early postoperative phase, resulting from focal outflow obstruction, may be crucial for the development of a small-for-size syndrome. The exclusion of the outflow-obstructed zone from the functional liver mass during preoperative radiological risk assessment seems to be the logical consequence. Recovery of focal outflow obstruction occurs spontaneously by means of dilated sinusoids in the border zone, forming vascularized sinusoidal canals, which could serve as intrahepatic anastomosis.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/recovery-liver-perfusion-after-focal-outflow-obstruction-liver-resection"},{"title":"Development of high performance PPVs: implications of the polymer-microstructure","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Heinrich","last_name":"Becker","scopus_author_id":"36478132000"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Gelsen","scopus_author_id":"6508070151"},{"first_name":"Edgar","last_name":"Kluge","scopus_author_id":"57197984917"},{"first_name":"Willi","last_name":"Kreuder","scopus_author_id":"6602372297"},{"first_name":"Hermann","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"36847871400"},{"first_name":"Hubert","last_name":"Spreitzer","scopus_author_id":"7003809142"}],"year":2000,"source":"Synthetic Metals","identifiers":{"sgr":"0033690530","scopus":"2-s2.0-0033690530","pui":"450141430","issn":"03796779","doi":"10.1016/S0379-6779(99)00330-6"},"pages":"145-149","volume":"111","month":6,"day":1,"id":"30112c84-d727-3ca2-a6d0-ba109da5e3d6","abstract":"Poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s (PPVs) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications, especially for displays based on polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs).

This paper presents a new approach developed for acceleration of FETI solvers by Graphic Processing Units (GPU) using the Schur complement (SC) technique. By using the SCs FETI solvers can avoid working with sparse Cholesky decomposition of the stiffness matrices. Instead a dense structure in form of SC is computed and used by conjugate gradient (CG) solver. In every iteration of CG solver a forward and backward substitution which are sequential are replaced by highly parallel General Matrix Vector Multiplication (GEMV) routine. This results in 4.1 times speedup when the Tesla K20X GPU accelerator is used and its performance is compared to a single 16-core AMD Opteron 6274 (Interlagos) CPU. The main bottleneck of this method is computation of the Schur complements of the stiffness matrices. This bottleneck is significantly reduced by using new PARDISO-SC sparse direct solver. This paper also presents the performance evaluation of SC computations for three-dimensional elasticity stiffness matrices.

Methods We performed the procedures based on anatomic study. The ALPPS procedure consisted of a 70% PVL (occluding the left median, left lateral, and right lobes), parenchymal transection (median lobe) and partial (10%) hepatectomy (PHx; caudate lobe). The transection effect was evaluated by measuring the extent of hepatic atrophy or regeneration of individual liver lobes in the ALPPS and control groups (70% PVL and 10% PHx without transection). The survival rates after stage II resection and collateral formation within the portal vein system was examined. Results Anatomic study revealed a close spatial relationship between the demarcation line and the middle median hepatic vein. This enabled placing the transection plane without injuring the hepatic vein. Transection was achieved via stepwise clamping, followed by 2-3 parenchyma-preserving piercing sutures on both sides of the clamp. Ligated liver lobes atrophy was significantly enhanced after ALPPS compared with the control group. In contrast, both a significantly greater relative weight of the regenerated lobe and proliferation index on the first postoperative day were observed. All animals tolerated stage II-resection without complications. Portoportal collaterals were only observed in the control group. Conclusion We developed an anatomically precise technique for parenchymal transection. The lack of a dense vascular network between the portalized and deportalized lobes may play an important role in accelerating regeneration and atrophy augmentation.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/establishment-rat-model-associating-liver-partition-portal-vein-ligation-staged-hepatectomy"},{"title":"Improved photobiological H2 production in engineered green algal cells","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Kruse","scopus_author_id":"6701825675"},{"first_name":"Jens","last_name":"Rupprecht","scopus_author_id":"57188546106"},{"first_name":"Klaus Peter","last_name":"Bader","scopus_author_id":"7006379554"},{"first_name":"Skye","last_name":"Thomas-Hall","scopus_author_id":"8843484300"},{"first_name":"Peer Martin","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"7103105685"},{"first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Finazzi","scopus_author_id":"7005632152"},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Hankamer","scopus_author_id":"6602991059"}],"year":2005,"source":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","identifiers":{"isbn":"4952110656","scopus":"2-s2.0-26644462167","issn":"00219258","pui":"41443141","pmid":"16100118","sgr":"26644462167","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M503840200"},"pages":"34170-34177","volume":"280","issue":"40","month":10,"day":7,"id":"da38a355-fdee-399b-9284-94e75dfef578","abstract":"Oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use solar energy to split water (H2O) into protons (H+), electrons (e-), and oxygen. A select group of photosynthetic microorganisms, including the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has evolved the additional ability to redirect the derived H+ and e- to drive hydrogen (H2) production via the chloroplast hydrogenases HydA1 and A2 (H2 ase). This process occurs under anaerobic conditions and provides a biological basis for solar-driven H2 production. However, its relatively poor yield is a major limitation for the economic viability of this process. To improve H2 production in Chlamydomonas, we have developed a new approach to increase H+ and e- supply to the hydrogenases. In a first step, mutants blocked in the state 1 transition were selected. These mutants are inhibited in cyclic e- transfer around photosystem I, eliminating possible competition for e- with H2ase. Selected strains were further screened for increased H2 production rates, leading to the isolation of Stm6. This strain has a modified respiratory metabolism, providing it with two additional important properties as follows: large starch reserves (i.e. enhanced substrate availability), and a low dissolved O2 concentration (40% of the wild type (WT)), resulting in reduced inhibition of H2ase activation. The H2 production rates of Stm6 were 5-13 times that of the control WT strain over a range of conditions (light intensity, culture time, +/- uncoupler). Typically, approximately 540 ml of H2 liter(-1) culture (up to 98% pure) were produced over a 10-14-day period at a maximal rate of 4 ml h(-1) (efficiency = approximately 5 times the WT). Stm6 therefore represents an important step toward the development of future solar-powered H2 production systems.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/improved-photobiological-h2-production-engineered-green-algal-cells"},{"title":"Intrahepatic Size Regulation in a Surgical Model: Liver Resection-Induced Liver Regeneration Counteracts the Local Atrophy following Simultaneous Portal Vein Ligation","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Weiwei","last_name":"Wei","scopus_author_id":"55849655400"},{"first_name":"Tianjiao","last_name":"Zhang","scopus_author_id":"57104015600"},{"first_name":"Haoshu","last_name":"Fang","scopus_author_id":"35261514500"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Dirsch","scopus_author_id":"7004018031"},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"7005317789"},{"first_name":"André","last_name":"Homeyer","scopus_author_id":"35746227600"},{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"Gremse","scopus_author_id":"47061577600"},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"Zafarnia","scopus_author_id":"56423675600"},{"first_name":"Utz","last_name":"Settmacher","scopus_author_id":"35474214400"},{"first_name":"Uta","last_name":"Dahmen","scopus_author_id":"55789262800"}],"year":2016,"source":"European Surgical Research","identifiers":{"pmid":"27308828","sgr":"84976333262","scopus":"2-s2.0-84976333262","doi":"10.1159/000446875","issn":"14219921","pui":"610985570"},"keywords":["Intrahepatic size regulation","Liver regeneration","Partial hepatectomy","Portal hyperperfusion","Right portal vein ligation"],"pages":"125-137","volume":"57","issue":"1-2","month":7,"publisher":"S.

To achieve a better understanding of intrahepatic size regulation, we explored the size regulation of a portally deprived liver lobe on a liver subjected to concurrent portal vein ligation (PVL) and partial hepatectomy (PHx). MATERIALS AND METHODS Using a surgical rat model consisting of right PVL (rPVL) plus 70% PHx, we evaluated the size regulation of liver lobes 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after the operation in terms of liver weight and hepatocyte proliferation. Portal hyperperfusion was confirmed by measuring portal flow. The portal vascular tree was visualized by injection of a contrast agent followed by CT imaging of explanted livers. Control groups consisted of 70% PHx, rPVL, and sham operation. RESULTS The size of the ligated right lobe increased to 1.4-fold on postoperative day 7 when subjected to rPVL + 70% PHx. The right lobe increased to 3-fold when subjected to 70% PHx alone and decreased to 0.3-fold when subjected to rPVL only. The small but significant increase in liver weight after the combined procedure was accompanied by a low proliferative response. In contrast, hepatocyte proliferation was undetectable in the right lobe undergoing atrophy after PVL only. The caudate lobe in the rPVL + 70% PHx group increased to 4.6-fold, which is significantly more than in the other groups. This increase in liver weight was paralleled by persisting portal hyperperfusion and a prolonged proliferative phase of 3 days. CONCLUSIONS A discontinued portal blood supply does not always result in atrophy of the ligated lobe. The concurrent regenerative stimulus induced by 70% PHx seemed to counteract the local atrophy after a simultaneously performed rPVL, leading to a low but prolonged regenerative response of the portally deprived liver lobe. This observation supports the conclusion that portal flow is not necessary for liver regeneration. The persisting portal hyperperfusion may be crucial for the specific kinetics of prolonged liver regeneration after rPVL + 70% PHx in the portally supplied caudate lobe. Both observations deserve more attention regarding the underlying mechanism in further studies.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/intrahepatic-size-regulation-surgical-model-liver-resectioninduced-liver-regeneration-counteracts-lo"},{"title":"A fast and robust hepatocyte quantification algorithm including vein processing","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Tetyana","last_name":"Ivanovska","scopus_author_id":"35746005100"},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"7005317789"},{"first_name":"André","last_name":"Homeyer","scopus_author_id":"35746227600"},{"first_name":"Meihong","last_name":"Deng","scopus_author_id":"16202485800"},{"first_name":"Uta","last_name":"Dahmen","scopus_author_id":"55789262800"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Dirsch","scopus_author_id":"7004018031"},{"first_name":"Horst K.","last_name":"Hahn","scopus_author_id":"7402381436"},{"first_name":"Lars","last_name":"Linsen","scopus_author_id":"11940084400"}],"year":2010,"source":"BMC Bioinformatics","identifiers":{"sgr":"77949450603","pmid":"20219107","scopus":"2-s2.0-77949450603","pui":"358676447","isbn":"1471-2105","issn":"14712105","doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-11-124"},"volume":"11","month":3,"day":10,"id":"6ec22df7-7e7a-3eda-8818-4666db26455b","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Quantification of different types of cells is often needed for analysis of histological images. In our project, we compute the relative number of proliferating hepatocytes for the evaluation of the regeneration process after partial hepatectomy in normal rat livers. RESULTS: Our presented automatic approach for hepatocyte (HC) quantification is suitable for the analysis of an entire digitized histological section given in form of a series of images. It is the main part of an automatic hepatocyte quantification tool that allows for the computation of the ratio between the number of proliferating HC-nuclei and the total number of all HC-nuclei for a series of images in one processing run. The processing pipeline allows us to obtain desired and valuable results for a wide range of images with different properties without additional parameter adjustment. Comparing the obtained segmentation results with a manually retrieved segmentation mask which is considered to be the ground truth, we achieve results with sensitivity above 90% and false positive fraction below 15%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed automatic procedure gives results with high sensitivity and low false positive fraction and can be applied to process entire stained sections.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/fast-robust-hepatocyte-quantification-algorithm-including-vein-processing"},{"title":"Transcriptome for photobiological hydrogen production induced by sulfur deprivation in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Anh Vu","last_name":"Nguyen","scopus_author_id":"57191495840"},{"first_name":"Skye R.","last_name":"Thomas-Hall","scopus_author_id":"8843484300"},{"first_name":"Aliz??e","last_name":"Malno??","scopus_author_id":"25640025900"},{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Timmins","scopus_author_id":"25640374100"},{"first_name":"Jan H.","last_name":"Mussgnug","scopus_author_id":"6506564742"},{"first_name":"Jens","last_name":"Rupprecht","scopus_author_id":"57188546106"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Kruse","scopus_author_id":"6701825675"},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Hankamer","scopus_author_id":"6602991059"},{"first_name":"Peer M.","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"7103105685"}],"year":2008,"source":"Eukaryotic Cell","identifiers":{"pmid":"18708561","sgr":"55749106801","scopus":"2-s2.0-55749106801","doi":"10.1128/EC.00418-07","isbn":"1535-9786 (Electronic)\\r1535-9786 (Linking)","issn":"15359778","pui":"352643458"},"pages":"1965-1979","volume":"7","issue":"11","month":11,"id":"7f676dd5-9d72-39ed-a29b-381e74278bca","abstract":"Photobiological hydrogen production using microalgae is being developed into a promising clean fuel stream for the future.

Increasingly, the photosynthetic machinery is being used for the production of biofuels such as bio-ethanol, biodiesel and bio-H2. Fuel production efficiency is directly dependent on the solar photon capture and conversion efficiency of the system. Green algae (e.g. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) have evolved genetic strategies to assemble large light-harvesting antenna complexes (LHC) to maximize light capture under low-light conditions, with the downside that under high solar irradiance, most of the absorbed photons are wasted as fluorescence and heat to protect against photodamage. This limits the production process efficiency of mass culture. We applied RNAi technology to down-regulate the entire LHC gene family simultaneously to reduce energy losses by fluorescence and heat. The mutant Stm3LR3 had significantly reduced levels of LHCI and LHCII mRNAs and proteins while chlorophyll and pigment synthesis was functional. The grana were markedly less tightly stacked, consistent with the role of LHCII. Stm3LR3 also exhibited reduced levels of fluorescence, a higher photosynthetic quantum yield and a reduced sensitivity to photoinhibition, resulting in an increased efficiency of cell cultivation under elevated light conditions. Collectively, these properties offer three advantages in terms of algal bioreactor efficiency under natural high-light levels: (i) reduced fluorescence and LHC-dependent heat losses and thus increased photosynthetic efficiencies under high-light conditions; (ii) improved light penetration properties; and (iii) potentially reduced risk of oxidative photodamage of PSII.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/engineering-photosynthetic-light-capture-impacts-improved-solar-energy-biomass-conversion"},{"title":"Second Generation Biofuels: High-Efficiency Microalgae for Biodiesel Production","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Peer M.","last_name":"Schenk"},{"first_name":"Skye R.","last_name":"Thomas-Hall"},{"first_name":"Evan","last_name":"Stephens"},{"first_name":"Ute C.","last_name":"Marx"},{"first_name":"Jan H.","last_name":"Mussgnug"},{"first_name":"Clemens","last_name":"Posten"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Kruse"},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Hankamer"}],"year":2008,"source":"BioEnergy Research","identifiers":{"pmid":"19204894","doi":"10.1007/s12155-008-9008-8","isbn":"1215500890","issn":"1939-1234"},"pages":"20-43","volume":"1","issue":"1","websites":["http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12155-008-9008-8"],"month":3,"day":4,"id":"e98007b5-39f2-31d2-a6f4-cdff0f7d7a2f","abstract":"The use of fossil fuels is now widely accepted as unsustainable due to depleting resources and the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the environment that have already exceeded the “dangerously high” threshold of 450&nbsp;ppm CO2-e. To achieve environmental and economic sustainability, fuel production processes are required that are not only renewable, but also capable of sequestering atmospheric CO2. Currently, nearly all renewable energy sources (e.g. hydroelectric, solar, wind, tidal, geothermal) target the electricity market, while fuels make up a much larger share of the global energy demand (∼66%). Biofuels are therefore rapidly being developed. Second generation microalgal systems have the advantage that they can produce a wide range of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane and biohydrogen. Biodiesel is currently produced from oil synthesized by conventional fuel crops that harvest the sun’s energy and store it as chemical energy. This presents a route for renewable and carbon-neutral fuel production. However, current supplies from oil crops and animal fats account for only approximately 0.3% of the current demand for transport fuels. Increasing biofuel production on arable land could have severe consequences for global food supply. In contrast, producing biodiesel from algae is widely regarded as one of the most efficient ways of generating biofuels and also appears to represent the only current renewable source of oil that could meet the global demand for transport fuels. The main advantages of second generation microalgal systems are that they: (1) Have a higher photon conversion efficiency (as evidenced by increased biomass yields per hectare): (2) Can be harvested batch-wise nearly all-year-round, providing a reliable and continuous supply of oil: (3) Can utilize salt and waste water streams, thereby greatly reducing freshwater use: (4) Can couple CO2-neutral fuel production with CO2 sequestration: (5) Produce non-toxic and highly biodegradable biofuels. Current limitations exist mainly in the harvesting process and in the supply of CO2 for high efficiency production. This review provides a brief overview of second generation biodiesel production systems using microalgae.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/second-generation-biofuels-highefficiency-microalgae-biodiesel-production"},{"title":"The metabolome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii following induction of anaerobic H2 production by sulfur depletion","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Timmins","last_name":"Matthew","scopus_author_id":"35110641300"},{"first_name":"Wenxu","last_name":"Zhou","scopus_author_id":"7404515953"},{"first_name":"Jens","last_name":"Rupprecht","scopus_author_id":"57188546106"},{"first_name":"Lysha","last_name":"Lim","scopus_author_id":"35110573900"},{"first_name":"Skye R.","last_name":"Thomas-Hall","scopus_author_id":"8843484300"},{"first_name":"Anja","last_name":"Doebbe","scopus_author_id":"34569288000"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Kruse","scopus_author_id":"6701825675"},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Hankamer","scopus_author_id":"6602991059"},{"first_name":"Ute C.","last_name":"Marx","scopus_author_id":"35551125900"},{"first_name":"Steven M.","last_name":"Smith","scopus_author_id":"55607952000"},{"first_name":"Peer M.","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"7103105685"}],"year":2009,"source":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","identifiers":{"pmid":"19478077","sgr":"69949181500","scopus":"2-s2.0-69949181500","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M109.003541","isbn":"0021-9258 (Print)\\n0021-9258 (Linking)","issn":"00219258","pui":"355219886"},"pages":"23415-23425","volume":"284","issue":"35","month":8,"day":28,"id":"1ef4485a-58c2-3442-9896-906b9137f949","abstract":"The metabolome of the model species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been analyzed during 120 h of sulfur depletion to induce anaerobic hydrogen (H(2)) production, using NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and TLC. The results indicate that these unicellular green algae consume freshly supplied acetate in the medium to accumulate energy reserves during the first 24 h of sulfur depletion. In addition to the previously reported accumulation of starch, large amounts of triacylglycerides were deposited in the cells. During the early 24- to 72-h time period fermentative energy metabolism lowered the pH, H(2) was produced, and amino acid levels generally increased. In the final phase from 72 to 120 h, metabolism slowed down leading to a stabilization of pH, even though some starch and most triacylglycerides remained. We conclude that H(2) production does not slow down due to depletion of energy reserves but rather due to loss of essential functions resulting from sulfur depletion or due to a build-up of the toxic fermentative products formate and ethanol.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/metabolome-chlamydomonas-reinhardtii-following-induction-anaerobic-h2-production-sulfur-depletion"},{"title":"Forward and adjoint simulations of seismic wave propagation on emerging large-scale GPU architectures","type":"conference_proceedings","authors":[{"first_name":"Max","last_name":"Rietmann","scopus_author_id":"55696569300"},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Messmer","scopus_author_id":"35410066900"},{"first_name":"Tarje","last_name":"Nissen-Meyer","scopus_author_id":"16033642600"},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Peter","scopus_author_id":"23009834300"},{"first_name":"Piero","last_name":"Basini","scopus_author_id":"37560970800"},{"first_name":"Dimitri","last_name":"Komatitsch","scopus_author_id":"55927990900"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"6701544373"},{"first_name":"Jeroen","last_name":"Tromp","scopus_author_id":"7005551807"},{"first_name":"Lapo","last_name":"Boschi","scopus_author_id":"6701339145"},{"first_name":"Domenico","last_name":"Giardini","scopus_author_id":"7003322330"}],"year":2012,"source":"International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, SC","identifiers":{"issn":"21674329","sgr":"84877699080","doi":"10.1109/SC.2012.59","isbn":"9781467308069","scopus":"2-s2.0-84877699080","pui":"368902949"},"id":"27056861-3617-3963-9d9e-d6d0d0409731","abstract":"Computational seismology is an area of wide sociological and economic impact, ranging from earthquake risk assessment to subsurface imaging and oil and gas exploration. At the core of these simulations is the modeling of wave propagation in a complex medium. Here we report on the extension of the high-order finite-element seismic wave simulation package SPECFEM3D to support the largest scale hybrid and homogeneous supercomputers. Starting from an existing highly tuned MPI code, we migrated to a CUDA version. In order to be of immediate impact to the science mission of computational seismologists, we had to port the entire production package, rather than just individual kernels. One of the challenges in parallelizing finite element codes is the potential for race conditions during the assembly phase. We therefore investigated different methods such as mesh coloring or atomic updates on the GPU. In order to achieve strong scaling, we needed to ensure good overlap of data motion at all levels, including internode and host-accelerator transfers. Finally we carefully tuned the GPU implementation. The new MPI/CUDA solver exhibits excellent scalability and achieves speedup on a node-to-node basis over the carefully tuned equivalent multi-core MPI solver.

These findings are of importance for the design of new surgical procedures and for unde rstanding eventual complications following hepatic surgery.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/intrahepatic-vascular-anatomy-rats-mice-variations-surgical-implications"},{"title":"1,2-diazetines as useful tools for ring transformation reactions with isothiocyanates - A new entry to 1,3,4-thiadiazines","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Rainer","last_name":"Beckert","scopus_author_id":"7006138540"},{"first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Fleischhauer","scopus_author_id":"22233936800"},{"first_name":"Anja","last_name":"Darsen","scopus_author_id":"6505783825"},{"first_name":"Jennie","last_name":"Weston","scopus_author_id":"35579613100"},{"first_name":"Stephan","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"8976101400"},{"first_name":"Ariadna","last_name":"Batista","scopus_author_id":"36882012600"},{"first_name":"Ernst","last_name":"Anders","scopus_author_id":"7005667766"},{"first_name":"Helmar","last_name":"Görls","scopus_author_id":"7007006081"},{"first_name":"Manfred","last_name":"Döring","scopus_author_id":"7006825697"},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"Pufky","scopus_author_id":"8693449100"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Walter","scopus_author_id":"7005810738"}],"year":2005,"source":"Heterocycles","identifiers":{"issn":"03855414","sgr":"31344478249","doi":"10.3987/COM-05-10349","scopus":"2-s2.0-31344478249","pui":"43138305"},"pages":"1311-1320","volume":"65","issue":"6","id":"29cd83e6-0969-3d47-8045-919af3c13374","abstract":"1,2-Diazetines (1) can be acylated with isocyanates (2) to give semicyclic urea derivatives (3).

This paper provides an overview on an important step towards a SolarPACES guideline for CSP yield calculation. With the increasing number of CSP installations, standardization becomes more and more important for further reduction of costs and increase in quality. Yield calculation is a key issue throughout all phases of project development and throughout most of the involved players. Due to the need for more complex process models for CSP compared to other renewables like PV or wind, the yield calculation procedure is more demanding. Uncertainties in the process are covered by additional but partially unnecessary risk surcharges since systematic approaches for avoiding expensive redundancies in risk buffers are not available. It is the main motivation of the mentioned CSP yield calculation guideline to overcome this situation by providing a detailed methodology for yield calculation. A first comprehensive draft version has been compiled and will be subject of discussion in the SolarPACES working group guiSmo. The following sections illustrate the motivation for the guideline, the contents at a glance, as well as expected benefits for selected players.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/steps-towards-csp-yield-calculation-guideline-first-draft-discussion-solarpaces-working-group-guismo"},{"title":"Optimization for process plans in sheet metal forming","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Jörg","last_name":"Danzberg"},{"first_name":"Joost R.","last_name":"Duflou"},{"first_name":"József","last_name":"Váncza"},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Aerens"},{"first_name":"S.

IEA Energy Technology Essentials are regularly-updated briefs that draw together the best-available, consolidated information on energy technologies from the IEA network ETE02 Biofuel Production*  BIOFUEL TYPES AND PROCESS – Bioethanol production: conversion of starch or sugar-rich biomass (corn (maize), other cereals, sugar cane, etc.) into sugar, fermentation, and distillation. Advanced process: hydrolysis of ligno-cellulosic biomass, fermentation and distillation. Biodiesel production: extraction and esterification of vegetable oils, used cooking oils and animal fats using alcohols. Advanced processes: hydrogenation of oil and fat; gasification and catalytic conversion to liquid fuels (biomass to liquid, BTL). Biomethane: biogas from anaerobic digestors and landfills used as compressed gas in natural gas vehicles.  ENERGY INPUT AND EMISSIONS – Because of the variety of feedstocks and processes, figures vary widely and make it difficult to identify indicative values. Sugar-cane ethanol: fossil fuel input some 10%-12% of final energy and up to 90% CO 2 reduction compared with gasoline. Corn ethanol: high energy input and much smaller CO 2 reduction (15-25%). Ligno-cellulosic ethanol: total energy input may be higher than for corn ethanol, but most such energy could be provided from biomass itself, with CO 2 reduction up to 70% (100% with power co-generation). Biodiesel: about 30% energy input and up to 60% CO 2 reduction.  COSTS – High sensitivity to feedstock, process, land type and crop yield. Figures are only indicative (see Fig. 2). Sugar-cane ethanol (Brazil): $0.25-$0.35/litre of gasoline equivalent (lge), competitive with gasoline at $40-$50/bbl oil prices. Higher cost in other regions. Ethanol from corn (US) and sugar-beet (EU): $0.6-$0.8/lge. Ligno-cellulosic ethanol: at present over $1.0/lge (feedstock price $3.6/GJ), with potential reduction to $0.50/lge in the next decade. Biodiesel from animal fat: $0.4-$0.5/lde; Biodiesel from vegetable oil: $0.6-$0.8/lde; Biodiesel from BTL: > $0.9/lde.  POTENTIAL – Ethanol: Low ethanol-gasoline blends (5%-10%, E5-E10) can fuel gasoline vehicles with little if any engine modification. New flexi-fuel vehicles run on up to 85% blends. Ligno-cellulosic ethanol (from all kinds of biomass) may greatly increase feedstock variety and quantity, but requires further R&D. Several pilot/demo plants in operation in 2006-2007. Potential market: 45 EJ by 2050. Biodiesel: Low biodiesel-diesel blends (B5-B10) can fuel diesel vehicles with no engine change; low sulphur and particulate emissions. Synthetic biodiesel (BTL) is fully compatible with diesel fuel and engines. Potential market: 20 EJ by 2050. Global biomass potential is some 100-200 EJ per year by 2050 (10%-20% of total energy supply).  BARRIERS – Competition with food and fibre production for use of arable land; cost; regional market structure; biomass transport; lack of well managed agricultural practices in emerging economies; water and fertiliser use; conservation of bio-diversity; logistics and distribution networks. PROCESS - Bioethanol conventional production – Bioethanol is the most common biofuel, accounting for more than 90% of total biofuel usage. Conventional production is a well known process based on enzymatic conversion of starchy biomass into sugars, and/or fermentation of 6-carbon sugars with final distillation of ethanol to fuel grade. Ethanol can be produced from many feedstocks, including cereal crops, corn (maize), sugar cane, sugar beets, potatoes, sorghum, cassava. Co-products (e.g animal feed) help reduce production cost. If sugar cane is used, conversion into sugar is easier. Crushed stalk (bagasse) can be used to provide heat and power for the process and for other energy applications. The world's largest producers of bio-ethanol are Brazil (sugar-cane ethanol) and the United States (corn ethanol). Ethanol is used in low 5%-10% blends with gasoline (E5, E10) but also as E-85 in flex-fuel vehicles. In Brazil, gasoline must contain a minimum of 22% bioethanol.  Bioethanol advanced production -While conventional processes use only the sugar and starch biomass components, R&D focuses on advanced processes that utilise the all available ligno-cellulosic materials. These processes hold the potential to increase variety and quantity of suitable feedstock including cellulosic wastes, maize stover, cereal straw, food-processing wastes, as well as dedicated fast-growing plants such as poplar trees and switch-grass. Cellulosic feedstock could be grown on non arable land or be produced from integrated crops, which could considerably increase land availability.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/biofuels-industrial-strategy-south-africa-2"},{"title":"Origins and diversity of eukaryotic CO2-concentrating mechanisms: Lessons for the future","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Chisti","last_name":"Yusuf"},{"first_name":"Jia","last_name":"Yang"},{"first_name":"Ming","last_name":"Xu"},{"first_name":"Xuezhi","last_name":"Zhang"},{"first_name":"Qiang","last_name":"Hu"},{"first_name":"Milton","last_name":"Sommerfeld"},{"first_name":"Yongsheng","last_name":"Chen"},{"first_name":"H","last_name":"Xu"},{"first_name":"X","last_name":"Miao"},{"first_name":"Q","last_name":"Wu"},{"first_name":"Mark S.","last_name":"Wigmosta"},{"first_name":"André M.","last_name":"Coleman"},{"first_name":"Richard J.","last_name":"Skaggs"},{"first_name":"Michael H.","last_name":"Huesemann"},{"first_name":"Leonard J.","last_name":"Lane"},{"first_name":"Jonathan B.","last_name":"Shurin"},{"first_name":"Shovon","last_name":"Mandal"},{"first_name":"Rachel L.","last_name":"Abbott"},{"first_name":"Peer M.","last_name":"Schenk"},{"first_name":"Skye R.","last_name":"Thomas-Hall"},{"first_name":"Evan","last_name":"Stephens"},{"first_name":"Ute C.","last_name":"Marx"},{"first_name":"Jan H.","last_name":"Mussgnug"},{"first_name":"Clemens","last_name":"Posten"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Kruse"},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Hankamer"},{"first_name":"O.","last_name":"Pulz"},{"first_name":"Shiv","last_name":"Prasad"},{"first_name":"Anoop","last_name":"Singh"},{"first_name":"H.

The three major constituents comprising the CCM in the majority of eukaryotes are described. These include: (i) likely plasma- and chloroplast-membrane inorganic carbon transporters; (ii) a suite of carbonic anhydrase enzymes in strategic locations; and usually (iii) a microcompartment in which most Rubisco aggregates (the chloroplast pyrenoid). The molecular diversity of known CCM components are set against the current green algal model for their probable operation. The review then focuses on the kinetic and cystallographic interactions of Rubisco, which permit pyrenoid formation and CCM function. Firstly, we consider observations that surface residues of the Rubisco small subunit directly condition Rubisco aggregation and pyrenoid formation. Secondly, we reanalyse the phylogenetic progression in green Rubisco kinetic properties, and suggest that Rubisco substrate selectivity (the specificity factor, S(rel), and affinity for CO(2), K(c)) demonstrate a systematic relaxation, which directly relates to the origins and effectiveness of a CCM. Finally, we consider the implications of eukaryotic CCM regulation and minimum components needed for introduction into higher plants as a possible means to enhance crop productivity in the future.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/origins-diversity-eukaryotic-co2concentrating-mechanisms-lessons-future"},{"title":"Selection of microalgae for lipid production under high levels carbon dioxide","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Ana P.","last_name":"Carvalho"},{"first_name":"Lu??s A.","last_name":"Meireles"},{"first_name":"F.

The study focused on the effects of realistic levels of engine exhaust emissions of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline (GSN) on Phormidium sp. and Chlorella sp. Multi parameters including pH, different medial compositions, fuel types, flow rates and biomass concentrations were described in detail. Effects of some growth factors such as triacontanol (TRIA) and salicylic acid (SA) have also been tested. The maximum biomass concentration of Phormidium sp. reached after 15 days at 0.36 and 0.15. g/L initial biomass concentrations were found as 1.160. g/L for LPG emission treated cultures and 1.331. g/L for GSN emission treated cultures, respectively. The corresponding figures were 1.478. g/L for LPG emission treated cultures and 1.636. g/L for GSN emission treated cultures at 0.65 and 0.36. g/L initial Chlorella sp. biomass concentrations.

use of petroleum sourced fuels is now widely recognized as unsustainable because of depleting supplies and the contribution of these fuels to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the environment. Renewable, carbon neutral, transport fuels are necessary for environmental and economic sustainability. Biodiesel derived from oil crops is a potential renewable and carbon neutral alternative to petroleum fuels. Unfortunately, biodiesel from oil crops, waste cooking oil and animal fat cannot realistically satisfy even a small fraction of the existing demand for transport fuels. As demonstrated here, microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels. Like plants, microalgae use sunlight to produce oils but they do so more efficiently than crop plants. Oil productivity of many microalgae greatly exceeds the oil productivity of the best producing oil crops. Approaches for making microalgal biodiesel economically competitive with petrodiesel are discussed.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/chemical-composition-algal-cell-walls-1"},{"title":"An

This article describes a virtual technique for transferring the location of a digitized cast from the patient to a virtual articulator (virtual facebow transfer). Using a virtual procedure, the maxillary digital cast is transferred to a virtual articulator by means of reverse engineering devices. The following devices necessary to carry out this protocol are available in many contemporary practices: an intraoral scanner, a digital camera, and specific software. Results prove the viability of integrating different tools and software and of completely integrating this procedure into a dental digital workflow.

These products can meet heating and power needs or serve as transportation fuels. The primary objective of this work is to present established and emerging energy conversion opportunities that can transform the treatment of livestock waste from a liability to a profit center. While biological production of methanol and hydrogen are in early research stages, anaerobic digestion is an established method of generating between 0.1 to 1.3 m3 m-3 d-1 of methane-rich biogas. The TCC processes of pyrolysis, direct liquefaction, and gasification can convert waste into gaseous fuels, combustible oils, and charcoal. Integration of biological and thermal-based conversion technologies in a farm-scale hybrid design by combining an algal CO2-fixation treatment requiring less than 27,000 m2 of treatment area with the energy recovery component of wet gasification can drastically reduce CO2 emissions and efficiently recycle nutrients. These designs have the potential to make future large scale confined animal feeding operations sustainable and environmentally benign while generating on-farm renewable energy.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/livestock-wastetobioenergy-generation-opportunities"},{"title":"Design and analysis of synthetic carbon fixation pathways","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"N.

However, the effect of trace metal toxicity on amino acid composition of Chlorella vulgaris as a function of varying nitrogen concentrations is not known. In this research, C. vulgaris was used to investigate the influence of cadmium (10-7 and 2.0??10-8molL-1 Cd) under varying nitrogen (2.9??10-6, 1.1??10-5 and 1.1??10-3molL-1N) concentrations on its growth rate, biomass and biochemical composition. Total carbohydrates, total proteins, total lipids, as well as individual amino acid proportions were determined. The combination of Cd stress and N limitation significantly inhibited growth rate and cell density of C. vulgaris. However, increasing N limitation and Cd stress stimulated higher dry weight and chlorophyll a production per cell. Furthermore, biomolecules like total proteins, carbohydrates and lipids increased with increasing N limitation and Cd stress. Ketogenic and glucogenic amino acids were accumulated under the stress conditions investigated in the present study. Amino acids involved in metal chelation like proline, histidine and glutamine were significantly increased after exposure to combined Cd stress and N limitation. We conclude that N limitation and Cd stress affects the physiology of C. vulgaris by not only decreasing its growth but also stimulating biomolecule production.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/combined-nitrogen-limitation-cadmium-stress-stimulate-total-carbohydrates-lipids-protein-amino-acid"},{"title":"Muscle force depends on the amount of transversal muscle loading","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Guang Quan","last_name":"Zhou"},{"first_name":"Phoebe","last_name":"Chan"},{"first_name":"Yong Ping","last_name":"Zheng"},{"first_name":"Karl E.","last_name":"Zelik"},{"first_name":"Tzu Wei P","last_name":"Huang"},{"first_name":"Peter G.","last_name":"Adamczyk"},{"first_name":"Arthur D.","last_name":"Kuo"},{"first_name":"Tishya a.L","last_name":"Wren"},{"first_name":"Scott a","last_name":"Yerby"},{"first_name":"Gary S","last_name":"Beaupré"},{"first_name":"Dennis R","last_name":"Carter"},{"first_name":"M.

purposes of this study were to create a three-dimensional representation of strain during isometric contraction in vivo and to interpret it with respect to the muscle fiber direction. Diffusion tensor MRI was used to measure the muscle fiber direction of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of seven healthy volunteers. Spatial-tagging MRI was used to measure linear strains in six directions during separate 50% maximal isometric contractions of the TA. The strain tensor (E) was computed in the TA's deep and superficial compartments and compared with the respective diffusion tensors. Diagonalization of E revealed a planar strain pattern, with one nonzero negative strain (ε(N)) and one nonzero positive strain (ε(P)); both strains were larger in magnitude (P < 0.05) in the deep compartment [ε(N) = -40.4 ± 4.3%, ε(P) = 35.1 ± 3.5% (means ± SE)] than in the superficial compartment (ε(N) = -24.3 ± 3.9%, ε(P) = 6.3 ± 4.9%). The principal shortening direction deviated from the fiber direction by 24.0 ± 1.3° and 39.8 ± 6.1° in the deep and superficial compartments, respectively (P < 0.05, deep vs. superficial). The deviation of the shortening direction from the fiber direction was due primarily to the lower angle of elevation of the shortening direction over the axial plane than that of the fiber direction. It is concluded that three-dimensional analyses of strain interpreted with respect to the fiber architecture are necessary to characterize skeletal muscle contraction in vivo. The deviation of the principal shortening direction from the fiber direction may relate to intramuscle variations in fiber length and pennation angle.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/muscle-force-depends-amount-transversal-muscle-loading"},{"title":"Geochemical characterization of recent sediments in the Baltic Sea by bulk and electron microprobe analysis","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Dalton S.","last_name":"Hardisty"},{"first_name":"Natascha","last_name":"Riedinger"},{"first_name":"Noah J.","last_name":"Planavsky"},{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Asael"},{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Andren"},{"first_name":"Bo B.","last_name":"JØrgensen"},{"first_name":"Timothy W.","last_name":"Lyons"},{"first_name":"Silke","last_name":"Severmann"},{"first_name":"Peter A","last_name":"Staehr"},{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Testa"},{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Carstensen"},{"first_name":"Swedish","last_name":"Meteorological"},{"first_name":"Jan Hinrich","last_name":"Reissmann"},{"first_name":"Hans","last_name":"Burchard"},{"first_name":"Rainer","last_name":"Feistel"},{"first_name":"Eberhard","last_name":"Hagen"},{"first_name":"Hans Ulrich","last_name":"Lass"},{"first_name":"Volker","last_name":"Mohrholz"},{"first_name":"Günther","last_name":"Nausch"},{"first_name":"Lars","last_name":"Umlauf"},{"first_name":"Gunda","last_name":"Wieczorek"},{"first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Gustafsson"},{"first_name":"Teresia","last_name":"Wällstedt"},{"first_name":"Christoph","last_name":"Humborg"},{"first_name":"Carl-magnus","last_name":"Mörth"},{"first_name":"B.

inductively\\ncoupled plasma optical emission spectrometry), as well as by electron\\nprobe X-ray microanalysis (EPXMA). Processing of the EPXMA-data resulted\\nin nine different particle types which have been identified as different\\nmineral species. Quartz and aluminosilicate particles are most abundant\\n(often more than 95%), although they are not of much help for the\\ncharacterization of the geochemistry of Baltic sediments. Reduction\\nproducts, such as Fe-sulfides and rhodochrosite, are found in anoxic\\nsediment environments (e.g. Gotland Deep). The oxides/hydroxides\\nof iron and manganese are more indicative of oxic environments (e.g.\\nKattegat). In regions with periodic changes in the redox conditions,\\noxides/hydroxides and sulfides are detected side by side (e.g. L�beck\\nBight, Arkona Basin). The detected Ca- and Ti-rich particles show\\na geographical dependence. The Ca-rich particles are found in the\\ntransition region between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. Ti-rich\\nparticles have high abundances around the coastlines of Germany (e.g.\\nL�beck Bight) and southern Poland. The results of the bulk analysis\\nand of the individual particle analysis are often complementary.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/geochemical-characterization-recent-sediments-baltic-sea-bulk-electron-microprobe-analysis-3"},{"title":"The growth, lipid and hydrocarbon production of Botryococcus braunii with attached cultivation","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Forestier"},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"King"},{"first_name":"Liping","last_name":"Zhang"},{"first_name":"Matthew C","last_name":"Posewitz"},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"Schwarzer"},{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Happe"},{"first_name":"Maria L.","last_name":"Ghirardi"},{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Seibert"},{"first_name":"Mark E.","last_name":"Huntley"},{"first_name":"Donald G.","last_name":"Redalje"},{"first_name":"Oliver R.","last_name":"Inderwildi"},{"first_name":"Stephen J.","last_name":"Jenkins"},{"first_name":"David A.","last_name":"King"},{"first_name":"E.","last_name":"Molina"},{"first_name":"F.G.","last_name":"Acién Fernández"},{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"García Camacho"},{"first_name":"F.","last_name":"Camacho Rubio"},{"first_name":"Yusuf","last_name":"Chisti"},{"first_name":"Bojan","last_name":"Tamburic"},{"first_name":"Fessehaye W.","last_name":"Zemichael"},{"first_name":"Geoffrey G.C.

laboratory to industrial scale. Two main aspects are investigated and presented, which to the best of our knowledge have never been addressed, namely the construction of an accurate dynamic model to simulate cyanobacterial photo-heterotrophic growth and biohydrogen production and the prediction of the maximum biomass and hydrogen production in different scales of photobioreactors. To achieve the current goals, experimental data obtained from a laboratory experimental setup are fitted by a dynamic model. Based on the current model, two key original findings are made in this work. First, it is found that selecting low -chlorophyll mutants is an efficient way to increase both biomass concentration and hydrogen production particularly in a large scale photobioreactor. Second, the current work proposes that the width of industrial scale photobioreactors should not exceed 0.20 m for biomass cultivation and 0.05 m for biohydrogen production, as severe light attenuation can be induced in the reactor beyond this threshold.

in more complex problems: given a matrix A and a vector b? , find a vector x? such that Ax? =b? . We consider the case where one does not need to know the solution x? itself, but rather an approximation of the expectation value of some operator associated with x? , e.g., x? �Mx? for some matrix M. In this case, when A is sparse, N?N and has condition number ?, the fastest known classical algorithms can find x? and estimate x? �Mx? in time scaling roughly as N?�. Here, we exhibit a quantum algorithm for estimating x? �Mx? whose runtime is a polynomial of log(N) and ?. Indeed, for small values of ? [i.e., polylog(N)], we prove (using some common complexity-theoretic assumptions) that any classical algorithm for this problem generically requires exponentially more time than our quantum algorithm.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/quantum-algorithm-linear-systems-equations-7"}]
