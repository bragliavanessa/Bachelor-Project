With the human- centric vision of ubiquitous computing, a concept like trust seems to gain additional importance as it already forms the basic building block of societies and thus should play an important role in any computer-mediated social network. However, the way the concept of trust is currently introduced into ubiquitous computing systems often seems either too simplistic, or overly complex. This paper argues for a renewed evaluation of the benefits from introducing the concept of trust into computational frameworks and proposes to leave trust assessment in ubiquitous computing envi- ronments up to humans.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/trust-not-computethe-role-trust-ubiquitous-computing"},{"title":"Secure localised storage based on super-distributed RFID-tag infrastructures","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Langheinrich","scopus_author_id":"23389746300"}],"year":2007,"source":"Journal of Location Based Services","identifiers":{"issn":"17489733","sgr":"85024174281","doi":"10.1080/17489720802008083","isbn":"1424412404","scopus":"2-s2.0-85024174281","pui":"449709612"},"keywords":["Access control","Localised storage","Privacy","RFID","Secure storage","Smart environments"],"id":"12db01f5-2aac-329e-9224-7b0cca526592","abstract":"Smart environments and wearables will make the storage and subsequent sharing of digitized multimedia diaries and meeting protocols - whom we meet, or what we say or do - cheap and easy. However, controlling access to this data will become cumbersome if traditional forms of access control are to be used: Overly restrictive rules might deny the potential of data sharing, while a lack of control could easily lead to Orwellian surveillance scenarios. This paper presents FragDB, a storage concept based on localized access control, where data storage and retrieval are bound to a specific place, rather than the knowledge of a particular password or certificate. FragDB uses tiny RFID tags embedded in the environment to compute a local key that is used to encrypt and decrypt data in a global storage system. We describe the design and implementation of an initial prototype. ©2007 IEEE.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/secure-localised-storage-based-superdistributed-rfidtag-infrastructures"},{"title":"Privacy by Design - Principles of Privacy-Aware Ubiquitous Systems","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Langheinrich"}],"year":2001,"source":"Third International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp 2001)","identifiers":{"arxiv":"9780201398298","pmid":"4520227","isbn":"3-540-42614-0","issn":"03029743","doi":"10.1007/3-540-45427-6_23"},"keywords":["Pervasive Computing","Ubiquitous computing","design","design principles","fair information practices","legal issues","privacy"],"id":"4569044e-b871-36a0-b6a5-421163df2ff1","abstract":"Introduction to privacy issues in PC/UC - use to outline structure to explore the implications and responses to privacy concerns in ubicomp literature.

With the help of a DC privacy troubadour action, the author envisioned harnessing such implicit concerns and unspoken ideas to create an explicit account of the “state of privacy” on the cumulative minds of ubiquitous computing researchers. However, after visiting four DC projects at five different locations, it became clear that even though general concerns for privacy remain high, few researchers have actually thought about such problems enough to be providing additional insights. This paper tries to formulate an initial set of hypotheses that explain this discrepancy between privacy concern and design effort, based on interviews with DC-researchers.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/dcprivacy-troubadour-assessing-privacy-implications-dcprojects-2003-june"},{"title":"Privacy by Design - Principles of Privacy-Aware Ubiquitous Systems","type":"conference_proceedings","authors":[{"first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Langheinrich"}],"year":2001,"source":"Ubicomp","identifiers":{"isbn":"3-540-42614-0","doi":"10.1007/3-540-45427-6_23"},"id":"02101816-6903-3d95-842a-89e37c7cc2d9","abstract":"This paper tries to serve as an introductory reading to privacy issues in the field of ubiquitous computing.

In his 1991 Scientific American article, Mark Weiser already identified it as one of its biggest challenges: “Perhaps key among [the social issues that embodied virtuality will engender] is privacy: hundreds of computers in every room, all capable of sensing people near them and linked by high-speed networks, have the potential to make totalitarianism up to now seem like sheerest anarchy.” [1] It would be nice if by now, almost two decades later, we would have a standard set of solutions that we could easily prescribe for any ubicomp system (or any computer system in general): “in order to protect privacy, implement subroutines A, B, and C.” Unfortunately, privacy is such a complex issue that there is no single solution, no recipe for success, no silver bullet (or set of silver bullets) that will “fix” a system for us so that it is “privacy-safe”. What exactly does it mean anyway, for a system to be “privacy-safe”? Whose privacy does it protect, when, and to what extent? None of these questions can be answered in general. Instead of a simple one-size-fits-all recipe, one needs to look into each single system and application in great detail, first understanding what the system does and what the implications of this are, and then working out how (and why) this needs to be changed in order to reach the “right” behavior. This chapter attempts to provide some guidance for this process. First, by explaining the concept of privacy in more detail, so one understands what it is that should be protected. Second, by giving some examples on how technology can safeguard personal information in ubicomp systems. This chapter is not meant as a cookbook that allows one to quickly find a solution for a particular problem, but rather as a starting point for recognizing and approaching privacy issues in one’s own design, development, or use of ubicomp systems and applications.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/privacy-ubiquitous-computing"}]
