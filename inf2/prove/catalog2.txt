Per il Decreto: traduzione dal francese della rivista. - «Le celebrazioni penitenziali collettive devono concludersi, secondo le norme del rituale, o con la confessione e l’assoluzione individuali o con una semplice domanda di perdono di forma deprecativa (sotto forma di preghiera)… L’assoluzione generale non può pertanto essere concessa se non in caso di “pericolo imminente di morte” (CIC can. 961 § 1, 1°)». Con un apposito decreto  «Revisioni delle norme particolari del Codice di diritto canonico (serie VI). Decreto riguardante il can. 961 del CIC»  la Conferenza dei vescovi svizzeri riduce le celebrazioni penitenziali con assoluzione generale. Il documento, pubblicato il 1° gennaio, armonizza la prassi penitenziale dei cattolici svizzeri a quella prevista dal Codice di diritto canonico (CIC) e dal motu proprio Misericordia Dei del 2002. Si conclude così un percorso di sperimentazione iniziato nel 1974; già nella nota pastorale Impulsi per rinnovare la confessione individuale nel quadro della pastorale del perdono (6.12.2007) i vescovi riconoscevano la necessità di rinnovare la consuetudine pastorale della confessione individuale, limitando l’uso dell’assoluzione generale (cf.

Queste misure di economia colpiranno in particolare i quotidiani romandi «Le Matin», «24 Heures» e «Tribune de Genève», ha dichiarato oggi il caporedattore di «Le Temps», Pierre Veya, confermando un'informazione diffusa dalla radio RTS. Contrariamente alle altre tre testate appartenenti a Tamedia, «Le Temps» non sarà toccato da questi provvedimenti. Il giornale ginevrino, che non è di proprietà esclusiva del gruppo zurighese - il 45% delle azioni è di Tamedia, un altro 45% di Ringier - aveva infatti già dovuto intervenire sul personale nell'autunno scorso. I caporedattori di «Le Matin», «24 Heures» e «Tribune de Genève», che dovranno effettuare tagli per 18 milioni di franchi, cercano ora il dialogo con la direzione di Tamedia. Il gruppo zurighese ha chiuso l'esercizio 2012 con un utile netto in calo del 15% rispetto al 2011 a 152 milioni di franchi. L'anno scorso Tamedia ha ulteriormente ampliato la sua presenza digitale e operato all'estero, senza peraltro perdere di vista le attività di base con i giornali e le riviste in Svizzera. Sebbene siano minoritari all'interno di Tamedia, i titoli romandi saranno interessati in misura maggiore dalle misure di risparmio. A questo proposito, l'Associazione dei giornalisti svizzeri Impressum denuncia quella che considera «una minaccia alla diversità della stampa e alla qualità dell'informazione». Il sindacato dei media Syndicom ritiene invece il provvedimento «ingiustificabile» dal punto di vista economico. Il programma di risparmio porterà inevitabilmente a numerosi licenziamenti, o persino alla soppressione o alla fusione di quotidiani, scrive oggi Impressum in una nota. Dal canto suo, Syndicom non comprende la decisione di Tamedia. Nel 2011, il gruppo zurighese aveva registrato il risultato migliore della sua storia e l'esercizio 2012 si è chiuso pur sempre con un utile, anche se inferiore a quello dell'anno precedente, sottolinea l'associazione dei giornalisti.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/tamedia-risparmia-34-milioni"},{"title":"La Ferriera, Locarno, Svizzera 2003","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Livio","last_name":"Vacchini"}],"year":2004,"source":"Casabella","keywords":["Locarno","Vacchini, Livio","composizione architettonica","edifici per uffici"],"pages":"24-37","volume":"LXVIII, 72","id":"54d9b119-aa32-3990-8cea-8244724f35a5","abstract":"Roberto Masiero, Perché si ritorna sempre a Stonehenge.

My aim is to build a computational model for moral emotions in order to enable intelligent agents [2] to understand moral consequences of actions through moral emotions. The agent is able to compare alternative scenarios and to decide what course of actions and goals to pursue in order to show a morally driven behavior. Moral emotions are useful when the agent is engaged in a social interaction with a user or other agents, because (i) moral emotions may lead the agent towards the compliance with (shared) moral values (ii) the agent is equipped with moral emotions which make her po- tentially emphatic to others.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/agents-moral-dimension-doctoral-consortium"},{"title":"E-lib.ch: prende forma la Biblioteca elettronica svizzera","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Matthias","last_name":"T+¦we"}],"year":2008,"source":"Biblioteche Oggi","identifiers":{"issn":"03928586","doi":"Article"},"keywords":["Bibliotecas universitarias Recursos electrónicos B"],"pages":"47-51","volume":"26","websites":["http://www.bibliotecheoggi.it/"],"id":"dc02b84c-e7f1-330f-9724-ba2b1bb46b06","abstract":"In the last years Swiss university libraries have received strong support from the Swiss university conference (SUC) in order to improve the availability of electronic information resources for research and teaching.

With respect to autonomy, our approach considers the choices that each agent has, and how their choices are coordinated so that at any time one agent leads and its counterpart follows, but with initiative fluidly shifting among the participants. With respect to heterogeneity, we characterize the variations in the agents' designs, and show how an agent may conform to a specification or substitute for another agent.

This class of software exhibits new features that often demand for rethinking and extending the traditional methodologies and the accompanying methods and techniques. In this thesis we deal with a particular class of open-world software, represented by service-based applications (SBAs). We focus on three specific aspects related to the development and provisioning of SBAs: specification, verification, and reputation management. With respect to these aspects, we provide methods and techniques that are i) suitable to deal with aspects such as change, evolution, and reliance on thirdparties, and ii) able to improve the overall quality of the systems they are applied to. More specifically, concerning specification, we report on the findings of a study that analyzed requirements specifications of SBAs developed in research settings and in industrial settings. These findings have then driven the design of SOLOIST, a language used to specify the interactions of SBAs. Regarding verification, our contribution is twofold; we propose: i) a technique for automatically generating the behavioral interfaces of the partner services of a service composition, by decomposing the requirements specification of the composite service; ii) a framework for the definition of verification procedures (encoded as synthesis of semantic attributes associated with a grammar) that are made incremental using an approach based on incremental parsing and attributes evaluation techniques. Finally, as for reputation management, we present a reputation-aware service execution infrastructure, which manages the reputation of services used by composite SBAs in an automated and transparent manner.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/openworld-software-specification-verifaction-beyond"},{"title":"SimpleNLG-IT : adapting SimpleNLG to Italian","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"Mazzei"},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"Battaglino"},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"Bosco"},{"first_name":"Dipartimento","last_name":"Informatica"},{"first_name":"Corso","last_name":"Svizzera"}],"year":2016,"source":"The 9th International Conference on Natural Language Generation","pages":"184-192","id":"668321bd-a85c-3d85-862d-0754dfc9fc20","abstract":"This paper describes the SimpleNLG-IT re-aliser, i.e. the main features of the porting of the SimpleNLG API system (Gatt and Reiter, 2009) to Italian.

È quindi necessario sviluppare misure che permettano a tutte le tipologie di edifici, compresi quelli storici, di contribuire ad uno sviluppo sostenibile senza però rischiare di danneggiare irrimediabilmente le qualità storiche di costruzioni e/o aree urbane. Inoltre, per prevenire un uso indiscriminato delle applicazioni solari e investire nel modo più razionale possibile le risorse sia economiche che spaziali, devono essere analizzati vari metodi di utilizzazione con l’obiettivo di trovare il giusto equilibrio fra requisiti tecnici ed estetici. Procedure relative la progettazione di installazioni solari integrate in edifici storici sono essenziali per garantire che, sia l’aspetto visivo dei moduli (colore, schema, riflessione) che la griglia formata dall’unione di più moduli, (forme regolari, suddivisione dei campi, ubicazione sul tetto, ecc.) soddisfi contemporaneamente le esigenze relative il fabbisogno energetico e quelle relative la preservazione del retaggio architettonico. Lo scopo di questo progetto è quello di formalizzare una serie di criteri e raccomandazioni che permettano di definire una procedura adatta all’utilizzo di tecnologie solari nell’ambiente urbano, specialmente in quegli edifici le cui caratteristiche architettoniche, storiche e culturali devono essere considerate con attenzione. Questo studio è parte del progetto SuRHiB, il cui scopo principale è quello di sviluppare e analizzare nuovi materiali isolanti da utilizzare nel risanamento di edifici storici. Lo scopo del work package 7 “Concetti per l’integrazione del solare” è quello di realizzare un elenco di procedure tecniche e architettoniche che permettano di integrare le tecnologie solari attive negli edifici storici non protetti. Infatti, il potenziale utilizzo degli edifici storici nell’ambito dell’installazione di impianti solari è considerevole, ma alle condizioni attuali rischia di rimanere inutilizzato a causa delle barriere legali e socio-psicologiche che ancora sussistono nei confronti di queste tecnologie. Il rispetto per il patrimonio storico, la protezione del territorio e l’utilizzo di energie rinnovabile possono e devono essere conciliati, soprattutto in specifici contesti come gli edifici storici, protetti e non. È quindi necessario sviluppare precise strategie che non permettano di semplificare o limitare eccessivamente il concetto di “integrazione solare”, ma che invece consentano il perseguimento congiunto di questi tre obiettivi.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/surhib-risanamento-sostenibile-di-edifici-storici-wp-7-concetti-per-l-integrazione-del-solare"},{"title":"Towards Automated Rule Learning for Complex Event Processing","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"Margara"},{"first_name":"Politecnico","last_name":"Milano"},{"first_name":"Giordano","last_name":"Tamburrelli"},{"first_name":"Università","last_name":"Svizzera"}],"year":2013,"source":"Technical Report.

Writing such rulesmay be challenging, also for domain experts. It requires answering several questions: which events are relevant for the situa- tion to detect and which are not? Which values should they carry? Do they need to appear in a specific, temporal order? To answer these and similar questions, we developed iCEP, a framework based on machine learning techniques to help the users in determining the hidden causality between the events received from the external environment and the situ- ation to detect. iCEP analyzes historical traces and learns from them. It is a highly modular system, with different components considering different aspects of the rules. De- pending on their knowledge of the domain, users can decide which modules to deploy and can provide hints to guide the learning process and increase its precision. In this paper, we present the design and development of iCEP in details and we evaluate its precision in a range of situations.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/towards-automated-rule-learning-complex-event-processing-2"},{"title":"Geomorfositi del jura orientale (svizzera NW) e del piemonte centrale (Italia NW)","type":"conference_proceedings","authors":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"Costamagna","scopus_author_id":"36162315300"}],"year":2005,"source":"Geografia Fisica e Dinamica Quaternaria","identifiers":{"issn":"03919838","sgr":"77953840163","scopus":"2-s2.0-77953840163","pui":"359046925"},"keywords":["Geomorphosite","Inventory","Italy","Jurassic landscape","Switzerland"],"pages":"115-122","issue":"SUPPL. 7","id":"0cfe5f58-f38a-38d6-9c2d-a82465fd7d3a","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/geomorfositi-del-jura-orientale-svizzera-nw-e-del-piemonte-centrale-italia-nw"},{"title":"Lingua madre e commutazione di codice in immigrati italiani di seconda generazione nella svizzera tedesca","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Stephan","last_name":"Schmid","scopus_author_id":"36729641600"}],"year":1993,"source":"Multilingua","identifiers":{"issn":"16133684","sgr":"34248802091","doi":"10.1515/mult.1993.12.3.265","scopus":"2-s2.0-34248802091","pui":"400595114"},"pages":"265-290","volume":"12","issue":"3","id":"49b5814f-2576-31dc-baa6-a6be40e57613","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/lingua-madre-e-commutazione-di-codice-immigrati-italiani-di-seconda-generazione-nella-svizzera-tedes"},{"title":"Inventario odonatologico delle zone umide di importanza nazionale del canton Ticino (Svizzera)","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"F","last_name":"Lepori"},{"first_name":"T","last_name":"Maddalena"},{"first_name":"M","last_name":"Moretti"},{"first_name":"N","last_name":"Patocchi"},{"first_name":"A","last_name":"Maibach"}],"year":1998,"source":"Boll.soc.tician.sci.nat.","keywords":["Checklist","Fauna","Odonata","Odonate","Southern","Switzerland","check-list","odonate fauna","paper","site","sites"],"pages":"46","volume":"86","city":"Maibach S�rl, A., �tudes en environement, La Croix Rte de Moudon, CH-1610 Oron-la-Ville, Switzerland","id":"e571ca88-4d39-38ab-9c0c-a510c1eee582","abstract":"De Marmels & Schiess (1977) surveyed more than 600 sites throughout the canton Ticino (Southern part of Switzerland) in the 70th.

The Laghetto di Muzzano is a lake with a well–documented history of anthropogenic nutrient loading and eutrophication. This study examined the trends in water quality over the course of a growing season to determine the current nutrient status of the lake and the role of stratification for nutrient dynamics. It found high levels of nutrients, particularly phosphorus in the bottom waters of the lake after the establishment of both chemical and thermal stratification. Much of the phosphorus appears to result from internal loading, judging from the strong correlation between orthophosphate and iron in the hypoliminion. Further, several mixing events occurred during the sampling period, which might have contributed to additional algal blooms observed through the summer and early fall. The important role of internal loading in the Laghetto indicates that management actions to reverse eutrophication will take time and must first achieve a significant reduction in external loading","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/condizioni-e-tendenze-della-qualit%C3%A0-dellacqua-nel-laghetto-di-muzzano-svizzera-nel-periodo-maggioott"},{"title":"Erlebniswelt Alpen : Strategien im Erlebniswelt Alpen","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Sibylle Article","last_name":"Zeitschrift"},{"first_name":"Svizzera","last_name":"Band"},{"first_name":"Der","last_name":"Berg"},{"first_name":"Montagna","last_name":"Pdf"},{"first_name":"Persistenter","last_name":"Link"},{"first_name":"Ein","last_name":"Dienst"},{"first_name":"Eth-bibliothek","last_name":"Eth"}],"year":2008,"source":"Kunst + Architektur in der Schweiz","identifiers":{"doi":"10.5169/seals-394400"},"pages":"42-49","volume":"59","issue":"2","websites":["http://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?var=true&pid=kas-002:2008:59::398#194"],"id":"48b1a50f-7fab-3d81-8b9b-ece9dd447413","abstract":"Objekttyp: Article Zeitschrift: Kunst + Architektur in der Schweiz = Art + architecture en Suisse = Arte + architettura in Svizzera Band (Jahr): 59 (2008) Heft 2: Der Berg = La montagne = Montagna Persistenter Link: http://doi.org/10.5169/seals-394400 PDF erstellt am: 09.03.2017 Nutzungsbedingungen Die ETH-Bibliothek ist Anbieterin der digitalisierten Zeitschriften.

Such changes are duly depicted on the background of the changes in immigration to Switzerland and especially of the admission and integration policies experienced in the last thirty years.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/italians-switzerland-tschingg-frequentable-person-net-italiani-svizzera-da-tschingg-persone-frequent"},{"title":"Escursione geotopi nel Ticino in occasione dell'Assemblea dell'Accademia Svizzera di Scienze Naturali ad Airolo (23-26 settembre 1998)","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"M.","last_name":"Felber"},{"first_name":"P.","last_name":"Heitzmann"},{"first_name":"H.","last_name":"Furrer"},{"first_name":"M.","last_name":"Maggiori"},{"first_name":"H.","last_name":"Weissert"}],"year":1999,"source":"Geologia Insubrica","pages":"99-124","volume":"4/1","id":"c34f5248-2abf-31ee-9510-e954a1674fe2","abstract":"This paper presents some geological and geomorphological sites in the Canton of Ticino (Switzerland).","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/escursione-geotopi-nel-ticino-occasione-dellassemblea-dellaccademia-svizzera-di-scienze-naturali-ad"},{"title":"Zeitschrift für schweizerische Archäologie und Kunstgeschichte : ZAK = Revue suisse d'art et d'archéologie = Rivista svizzera d'arte e d'archeologia","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Malgorzata","last_name":"Schweizerisches Institut für Kunstwissenschaft (Zürich)"},{"first_name":"Gerwulf","last_name":"Gesellschaft für Schweizerische Kunstgeschichte."},{"last_name":"Schweizerisches Landesmuseum (Zürich)"}],"year":2001,"source":"Zeitschrift für Schweizerische Archäologie und Kunstgeschichte (ZAK)","pages":"25-32","volume":"58","issue":"1","websites":["http://openarchaeology.info/bibliography/klassifizierung-von-keramik-durch-nachbrennen-von-scherben"],"publisher":"Schwegler","id":"3daa5fb7-2826-39e8-ad7b-fccdfffd67a6","accessed":[2017,3,31],"abstract":"Beteil.

All'interno di: Viaggio apostolico a Berna (Svizzera). Da cuore a cuore. - «Alzati!... Ascolta!... Non avere paura!... Mettiti in cammino!». Ancora una volta Giovanni Paolo II parla ai giovani, da cuore a cuore, e sono quelli della Svizzera, dove il papa si è recato per il suo 103° viaggio internazionale (5-6.6.2004), il quarto in Svizzera (gli altri nel 1982,1984 e 1985), in occasione dell'incontro nazionale dei giovani cattolici della Confederazione. Il papa, con l'avanzare dell'infermità, non perde nulla della capacità di porsi in comunicazione diretta con i giovani e di proporsi - autorevolmente - come testimone: «Anch'io, come voi, ho avuto vent'anni. Mi piaceva fare sport, sciare, recitare. Studiavo e lavoravo. Avevo desideri e preoccupazioni. In quegli anni ormai lontani, in tempi in cui la mia terra natale era ferita dalla guerra e poi dal regime totalitario, cercavo il senso da dare alla mia vita. L'ho trovato nella sequela del Signore Gesù» (Incontro al Palaghiaccio, 5.6.2004). Accanto al calore dell'affetto manifestato per i giovani, l'altro nucleo della visita è stato quello delle relazioni ecumeniche: «Come non sentire impellente, di fronte a queste parole di Cristo, l’assillo ecumenico? Riaffermo, anche in questa circostanza, la volontà di avanzare sulla via difficile, ma ricca di gioia, della piena comunione di tutti i credenti» (omelia, 6.6.2004).","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/allocuzione-cari-giovani-svizzeri-berna-svizzera-occasione-dellincontro-nazionale-dei-giovani-cattol"},{"title":"Chiave di determinazione dei Chirotteri (Mammalia) della Svizzera attraverso l ' osservazione al microscopio ottico della struttura dei peli","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Riccardo","last_name":"Pierallini"},{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"Keller"},{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Moretti"}],"year":2004,"source":"Revue Suisse de Zoologie","identifiers":{"sgr":"3142766205","scopus":"2-s2.0-3142766205","pui":"38927802","issn":"0035-418X"},"keywords":["-","bat","chiroptera","pipistrellus pip","social structure"],"pages":"381-393","volume":"111","issue":"2","id":"dbf7ba86-de1c-3348-8551-2c80f540c80e","abstract":"Ident\\\\`\\\\if\\\\`\\\\icat\\\\`\\\\ionkey of bats (Ch\\\\`\\\\iroptera) from Sw\\\\`\\\\itzerland based on hair structnre observed through opt\\\\`\\\\ical m\\\\`\\\\icroscope, - The identif\\\\`\\\\ication of mammalian hairs by microscope remains an efficient and well-known technique, but only a few studies concern bats.

II Pensiero Scientifico Editore downloaded by Roberto Bonini IP.The implementation of recommendations in daily practice: the experience of the nurses of the Oncology institute of Southern Switzerland. Introduction. In spite of the wide spread and availability of the clinical practice guidelines, several problems limit and influence their implementation. Several studies explored how a protocol based care may influence nurses' decision making processes, while only few studies explored how it is used in everyday practice. Aim. This paper explores how the nurses of the Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland implement the care protocols and problems encountered. Methods. Information on the frequency of use of protocols in the previous month, the need and reasons for modifications were collected with a semistructured questionnaire. Nurses were asked to briefly describe the situations that required a change of the protocol. The nurses'perceptions on the use of protocols in clinical practice were further explored with a focus group. Results. Of the 47 questionnaires distributed 38 were returned and 18 cases briefly described. In general, the protocols were widely used but at the same time, frequently adapted mainly by expert nurses (although 19/39 nursed declared that protocols were never modified). Reasons for modifications were mainly related to the clinical situation of the patient, to his/her values and preferences. Conclusions. Instruments that standardize patients' care are frequently modified to account for patients preferences and characteristics. The nurses acknowledged the need of flexible instruments (and not hard rules) to guide their professional practice.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/lapplicazione-delle-raccomandazioni-nella-pratica-quotidiana-lesperienza-degli-infermieri-dellistitu"},{"title":"Coleotteri (Cerambycidae, Buprestidae, Lucanidae, Cetoniidae) del legno morto nei castagneti della Svizzera sudalpina – Sintesi dei risultati di tre studi","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Cinzia","last_name":"Pradella"},{"first_name":"Martin K","last_name":"Obrist"},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Duelli"},{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Conedera"},{"first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Moretti"},{"first_name":"Istituto","last_name":"Federale"},{"first_name":"Via","last_name":"Belsoggiorno"},{"first_name":"C H","last_name":"Bellinzona"},{"first_name":"C H","last_name":"Birmensdorf"}],"year":2010,"source":"Bollettino della Società ticinese di Scienze naturali","keywords":["castanea sativa","conservation","dead wood","forest management","saproxylic beetles","southern switzerland"],"pages":"35-44","volume":"98","id":"0cce2f4d-0ed1-35bc-856b-277e865ded69","abstract":"Nei boschi gestiti l’eccessiva rimozione del legno morto rappresenta spesso una minaccia per la sopravvivenza di numerose specie saproxiliche (che trascorrono parte del loro ciclo vitale nel legno morto), con effetti negativi per l’equilibrio ecologico del bosco, sia in termini di biodiversità, che dei processi di decomposizione del legno e del riciclo dei nutrienti. Di conseguenza, in numerosi paesi europei, tra cui la Svizzera, la conservazione del legno morto e della componente saproxilica sta assumendo notevole interesse. Nella Svizzera sudalpina tuttavia, dove la gestione riguarda superfici relativamente limitate di bosco, tale fenomeno rimane ancora poco conosciuto. In questo contesto, il nostro studio ha l’obiettivo di presentare una sintesi dei risultati di tre progetti sull’entomofauna saproxilica dei castagneti della Svizzera sudalpina (Ticino eMoesano) condotti presso l’Istituto federale di ricercaWSL di Bellinzona tra il 1997 e il 2004. In particolare sono mostrati gli esiti dei campionamenti dei coleotteri saproxilici appartenenti a quattro famiglie (Cerambycidae, Buprestidae, Lucanidae, Cetoniidae) realizzati mediante metodi stan- dard (principalmente trappole a caduta e trappole a finestra) all’interno di 7 unità tipologiche di castagneto definite in base a tre fattori: 1) la forma di governo (il ceduo – la selva); 2) la gestione pregressa e attuale (l’assenza di gestione – il recupero – la gestione regolare); 3) la presenza di un fattore post–colturale di disturbo (l’incendio). Complessivamente sono state campionate 85 specie, di cui 78 specie nei cedui e 36 specie nelle selve castanili. Ben 56 specie (66%) sono risultate esclusive di una unità tipologica o di un gruppo di unità tipologiche strutturalmente analo- ghe, alle quali si aggiungono 7 specie manifestamente abbondanti in singole unità tipologiche. Questi risultati rivelano una buona presenza di coleotteri saproxilici, tra cui specie rare e protette a livello nazionale, favorita in particolare dal- l’effetto positivo del mosaico delle differenti strutture dei castagneti sudalpini. In particolare le superfici gestite, rappre- sentate da ambienti aperti ed esposti al sole ben provvisti di legno morto e varie piante erbacee fiorite, costituiscono un elemento fondamentale per lo sviluppo delle specie saproxiliche. Sulla base dei risultati, suggeriamo infine alcuni con- sigli pratici sulla valorizzazione della necromassa legnosa applicabili durante gli interventi selvicolturali, tra cui la limi- tazione dell’esbosco del legno morto, la conservazione degli alberi senescenti e la promozione di radure e margini boschivi strutturati con cespugli ed essenze fiorite.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/coleotteri-cerambycidae-buprestidae-lucanidae-cetoniidae-del-legno-morto-nei-castagneti-della-svizze"},{"title":"Fuzzy Controller Synthesis in Robotic Assembly : Procedure and Experiments","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Marnix","last_name":"Nuttin"},{"first_name":"Hendrik Van","last_name":"Brussel"},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"Baroglio"},{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"Piola"},{"first_name":"Universita","last_name":"Torino"},{"first_name":"Dipartimento","last_name":"Informatica"},{"first_name":"Corso","last_name":"Svizzera"}],"year":1994,"source":"Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","identifiers":{"sgr":"0028756303","scopus":"2-s2.0-0028756303","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343648","isbn":"0-7803-1896-X","pui":"25638232"},"keywords":["automated fuzzy controller","fuzzy control","machine learning","robotic assembly"],"pages":"1217-1223","issue":"1","id":"73a1201f-51ca-324b-a796-3b134ffb4353","abstract":"Fuzzy controller for Peg-in-hiole process.

On one hand, clinicians are facing patients with an altered physiology that may cause a greater need for treatment. On the other hand, pregnancy in itself as well as the unborn child involves potential contraindications to dental interventions. It is therefore essential that dentists be knowledgeable of the ramifications pregnancy has on medical findings and therapy. Also, clinicians must be able to conduct their treatment based on well-grounded data to avoid any harm to the pregnant woman and her unborn child. This article focuses on facts specifically relevant to clinicians. Based on most current scientific data, we aim to answer the following ten questions: 1. What are the physiological changes during pregnancy? 2. What is the adequate lying position for a pregnant patient? 3. Is there a pregnancy-related gingivitis? 4. What is the association between periodontitis, pregnancy and preterm birth? 5. Are there oral manifestations of pregnancy-related therapies? 6. Are caries and erosions inevitable during pregnancy? 7.

Over 50% of all losses are due to quality defects in the potatoes.

Patient education is essential in promoting patient safety, adherence and clinical outcomes and nurses play a critical role in this field. This study explores how nurses provide education to patients, receiving oral cancer treatment, and how patients perceive education given by nurses to detect opportunities of clinical practice improvement. Material and Methods: This is a descriptive quantitative and qualitative study. Data have been collected with a semi-structured questionnaire, referring to MOATT®, given to all consenting patients receiving oral cancer treatment from at least one week, in four outpatients departments in Southern Switzerland. Sixteen in-depth interviews with patients and four focus groups with nurses have been done. A statistical analysis has been done for quantitative data while for qualitative ones NVivo 10 software has been used. The study has been approved by the local Ethical Committee. Results: One hundred-forty-two questionnaires have been analysed. Most participants are women (64.8%), have an intermediate instruction level (58.5%) and are assuming oral treatment for 1-6 months (39.4%) or more than an year (38%). The mean age is 65.2 years (±12.3). Most patients have been informed by both physicians and nurses (81%), alone (33%) or with caregivers (29.6%). Nurses provide information in a private room (40.9%), during the physician visit (23.5%), but also with other patients (18.3%). Language comprehensibility is high in the total population (72%) but lower in elder patients (65.3%) compared to patients <70 years (85%) (p = 0.04) while understanding evaluation is regularly done in 34.8% of all cases. Patients are mainly informed about modality of drug assumption, although less those in hormonal treatment (p = 0.012), and side effects identification and management. As a whole, patients give a good evaluation of education provided by nurses (VNRS: 8.59/10). The interviews data underline and enhance quantitative data with several issues such as the need of safety and the importance of having a reference nurse and of consistency between inter-professional communication. Nurses in focus groups point out issues such as the importance of formal and informal patient assessment to adjust education approach, expertise, training and organizational conditions. Conclusions: Patients in oral treatment are, in a whole, satisfied with education received and perceive there is concordance and integration between physicians and nurses information. Nurses should improve some aspects in setting organization, patient assessment and individualization of education approach. Organizational conditions may also be very important to enhance the nurses role in education.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/oral-cancer-therapy-nurses-patients-perceptions-about-education"},{"title":"LaRegione licenzia e ristruttura","type":"web_page","authors":[{"first_name":"Gianni","last_name":"Righinetti"}],"year":2012,"source":"Corriere del Ticino","pages":"7","websites":["http://www.cdt.ch/ticino-e-regioni/cronaca/72472/laregione-licenzia-e-ristruttura.html"],"month":11,"day":3,"id":"64dfc256-3ba3-3780-85aa-81fe97070df8","accessed":[2013,1,27],"abstract":"Soppresso il posto di corrispondente dalla Svizzera tedesca - Mancata sostituzione dei partenti","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/laregione-licenzia-e-ristruttura"},{"title":"Cambiamento di giurisprudenza del Tribunale federale svizzero in merito alla questione dell'uscita parziale dalla Chiesa cattolica","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"Eisenring"}],"year":2008,"source":"Ius Ecclesiae","keywords":["Abbandono chiesa con atto formale","Svizzera"],"pages":"663-672","volume":"20","id":"7069761c-885b-3b87-9b11-6311f30884de","abstract":"Commento alla sentenza (in tedesco) del 16 novembre 2007 del Tribunale Fedelrale della Svizzera.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/cambiamento-di-giurisprudenza-del-tribunale-federale-svizzero-merito-alla-questione-delluscita-parzi"},{"title":"[The Swiss health insurance carriers in managed care].","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"G","last_name":"Geser"}],"year":1996,"source":"Swiss Surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie Suisse = Chirurgia Svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332","pmid":"9312391"},"keywords":["Cost Control/trends","Cost-Benefit Analysis/trends","Forecasting","Health Services Misuse/economics","Humans","Insurance Carriers/*economics","Managed Care Programs/*economics","National Health Programs/*economics","Switzerland"],"pages":"148-153","volume":"2","issue":"4","websites":["http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=9312391&site=ehost-live"],"publisher":"Verlag Hans Huber","city":"Verband Zürcher Krankenversicherer.","id":"5a3003e3-523c-3ce5-b001-d5ede7e2f657","abstract":"The Swiss health care system is currently undergoing radical changes.

After the widespread clinical use in the staging of melanoma patients the snb is currently introduced in the clinical management of breast cancer patients. We present our experience with this method during 3, 5 years and discuss its potential and pitfalls. From 11/95 to 3/99 we performed sentinel node detection in 146 patients with breast cancer stage I to III, consisting of 127 patients with pT1/2-tumors and 19 patients with pT3/4-tumors. We used the radionuclid method including preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma-probe detection. The detection rate varied with the tumor size between 94% for tumors with a diameter < 1 cm, 85% (1-3 cm), 70% (3-5 cm) and 63% (> 5 cm). The accuracy of the snb in the prediction of the nodal status changed also with the tumor diameter between 100% for very small tumors (< 1 cm), 97% (1-3 cm), 88% (3-5 cm) and 67% (> 5 cm). In the subgroup of patients restricted to T1-2-tumors (n = 106). 57 patients (53%) showed true negative snb. 38 patients (36%) revealed tumor cells in the H&E-staining and an additional 7 patients (7%) solely in the immunohistochemical staining. 4 (4%) of these patients, all of them from the first half of the study period, underwent false-negative snb, 3 of them showing lymphangiosis carcinomatosa. The presented results show, that snb using the radionuclid method is a reliable method for the evaluation of the nodal status in early breast cancer patients with a tumor size up to ca. 3 cm. Therefore the sn procedure should be restricted to small tumors with clinically uninvolved axillary nodes or patients with a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to rule out invasiveness.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/sentinel-lymph-node-dissection-breast-cancer-3"},{"title":"[Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): integration of clinical and genetic parameters in the screening of subjects at risk.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A programme of endoscopy, ophthalmologic examination for retinal pigment lesions associated with FAP and genetic analysis was proposed to a patient suffering from FAP and 3 of his children considered to be at risk. RESULTS: One person at risk eventually proved to have the disease. He had diffuse recto-colic polyposis as well as the typical retinal lesions found in his father and was treated by prophylactic proctocolectomy. He had inherited the mutated paternal allele. The other 2 children had neither polyposis nor retinal lesions and had inherited the normal allele from their father. DISCUSSION: Retinal lesions seen at fundoscopy allowed the diagnosis of FAP to be made before endoscopic confirmation in one patient at risk for FAP, but their absence did not exclude the diagnosis in the other 2. In these patients genetic analysis revealed that they had inherited the normal paternal allele and hence would not develop FAP. CONCLUSION: Systematic investigation of a family suffering from FAP allowed the members at risk to be identified. Two subjects at risk were able to be excluded from further follow-up and the remaining patient was able to be treated in an optimal fashion. An algorithm is proposed for the screening of patients at risk.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/familial-adenomatous-polyposis-fap-integration-clinical-genetic-parameters-screening-subjects-risk-o"},{"title":"[Does acute graft rejection modify subsequent function of a transplanted liver?]","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"C A","last_name":"Seiler"},{"first_name":"E L","last_name":"Renner"},{"first_name":"A","last_name":"Czerniak"},{"first_name":"M W","last_name":"Büchler"}],"year":1995,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332","pmid":"9156818"},"keywords":["Acute Disease","Adult","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Graft Rejection","Graft Rejection: physiopathology","Humans","Liver Function Tests","Liver Transplantation","Liver Transplantation: physiology","Male","Middle Aged","Retrospective Studies"],"pages":"186-7","issue":"4","websites":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9156818"],"month":1,"id":"b0bfd1af-fbe5-359f-9ca9-3aefb0fd567c","accessed":[2010,7,29],"abstract":"While in kidney, heart and pancreas transplantation the impairment of graft function associated with acute rejection is only partially reversible upon successful antirejection therapy, little is known about the effect of acute rejection on late graft function after liver transplantation.

Even though the diagnosis of pancreatitis has become easier by the measurement of specific pancreatic enzymes there are still 30-40% of the fatal cases which are first diagnosed at autopsy. It is of utmost importance to assess the diagnosis and the severity of acute pancreatitis in the beginning to identify those patients with severe or necrotising disease who benefit from an early initiated intensive care therapy. Additionally, in view of new therapeutical concepts (e.g. antibiotic therapy in severe forms) and for the evaluation of new drugs, patients should be staged into mild and severe disease as early as possible. In most cases it is not possible to assess the severity clinically on hospital admission. Up to now the \"gold standard\" are imaging procedures (contrast-enhanced CT and MRI) which should be reserved for the severe cases to estimate the extent of pancreatic necrosis. The ideal predictor in blood or in urine should be objective, reliable, inexpensive, easy to measure, widely available, sensitive and specific. There are a variety of mediators of the \"systemic inflammatory response syndrome\" which are elevated in this disease (C-reactive protein, antiproteases, enzyme activation peptides like trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) and carboxypeptidase B activation peptide (CAPAP), PMN-elastase, complement factors, chemokines and interleukins and others). Among all these mediators, C-reactive protein is the parameter best analysed. It has to be taken into account that it is not specific for AP and it's highest efficacy is reached after > 48 hours after the onset of disease. However, because usually a certain time elapses (approximately 24-48 hours) until patients are hospitalised the time delay seems not to a major disadvantage.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/acute-pancreatitisclinical-technical-laboratory-diagnostic-prognostic-assessment"},{"title":"[Value of 3D CT in diagnosis and treatment of fractures of the tibial plateau].","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"P F","last_name":"Blaser"},{"first_name":"S","last_name":"Wicky"},{"first_name":"O","last_name":"Husmann"},{"first_name":"R A","last_name":"Meuli"},{"first_name":"P F","last_name":"Leyvraz"}],"year":1998,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"pmid":"9757807","issn":"1023-9332"},"pages":"180-6","issue":"4","websites":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9757807"],"id":"0bc61679-bf1b-3737-8ba6-f811a5898b41","accessed":[2016,8,24],"abstract":"A precise classification and an optimal understanding of tibial plateau fractures are the basis of a conservative treatment or adequate surgery.

We therefore analyzed strategic opportunities of the journal Swiss Surgery on the basis of customer surveys and of a market analysis. RESULTS Swiss surgeons expressed their interest in the continuation of the journal but also indicated their support for changes in its concept and for an increased use of electronic media. An international market analysis points-out the difficulties of national, non-english speaking journals in gaining impact points and in attracting authors and readers of scientific medical articles. Therefore, a journal such as Swiss Surgery should identify and use publication niches. RECOMMENDATION The demand for a concept addressing surgical training including continuous postgraduate education was confirmed by the customers of Swiss Surgery. A corresponding offer does not presently exist in the area and could become the new focus of the journal. This change of concept may have a number of consequences: A journal focusing on surgical training and education should use the results of readers' surveys rather than impact point assignment to evaluate quality. The journal should increasingly use electronic services including data bases, pictures, videos and closed user groups to supplement the print version. At short term, however, the printed version should be continued and not be substituted by the electronic version in order to maintain the established brand \"Swiss Surgery\".","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/swiss-surgery-quo-vadis-reader-market-analysis-strategic-positioning-specialty-journal"},{"title":"Morbidity and outcome after sentinel lymph node dissection in patients with early-stage malignant cutaneous melanoma.","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"R","last_name":"Blumenthal"},{"first_name":"A","last_name":"Banic"},{"first_name":"C U","last_name":"Brand"},{"first_name":"H B","last_name":"Ris"},{"first_name":"D","last_name":"Lardinois"}],"year":2002,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332 (Print)","pmid":"12422766"},"keywords":["Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Humans","Lymph Node Excision","Male","Melanoma","Middle Aged","Neoplasm Staging","Postoperative Complications","Prospective Studies","Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy","Skin Neoplasms","Survival Rate","etiology","mortality","pathology","surgery"],"pages":"209-214","volume":"8","issue":"5","id":"1abd182c-8889-34f2-ba11-fa724463a4a1","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Prospective analysis of the morbidity and outcome of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique in a consecutive series of patients with early-stage melanoma. METHODS: Between 1997 and 1998, 60 patients with stage IB-II malignant melanoma underwent SLN dissection. Preoperative dynamic lymphoscintigraphy with mapping of the lymph vessels and lymph nodes and location of the sentinel node was performed the day before SLN dissection. SLN was identified by use of the blue dye technique. SLN was assessed for histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were recorded. Follow-up consisted of repetitive clinical examination with lymph nodes status, laboratory and radiologic findings. RESULTS: Tumor-positive SLN was observed in 18% of the patients and stage II disease was found in 91% of the patients with positive SLN. Breslow thickness was the only significant factor predicting involvement of a SLN (p = 0.02). In 36% of the positive SLN, metastases could be assessed only by immunohistochemical examination. Postoperative complications after SLN dissection were observed in 5% in comparison with 36% after elective lymph node dissection. After a mean follow-up of 32 months, recurrence was observed in 3% with a mean disease-free survival of 8 months. Overall survival was 82% and 90% in patients with positive and negative SLN, respectively. Overall mortality was 15%, due to distant metastases in 78% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Staging of early-stage melanoma with the SLN dissection by use of the blue dye technique combined to lymphoscintigraphy and immunohistochemistry is reliable and safe, with less morbidity than elective lymphadenectomy. Long-term follow-up is mandatory to establish the exact reliability of SLN dissection.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/morbidity-outcome-after-sentinel-lymph-node-dissection-patients-earlystage-malignant-cutaneous-melan-1"},{"title":"[Morphology of abdominal aortic aneurysms with reference to endovascular blood vessel prosthesis].","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"B","last_name":"Marty"},{"first_name":"L K","last_name":"von Segesser"},{"first_name":"W","last_name":"Schopke"},{"first_name":"J","last_name":"Muntwyler"},{"first_name":"M","last_name":"Turina"}],"year":1996,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332 (Print)","pmid":"8963848"},"keywords":["Aged","Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal","Blood Vessel Prosthesis","Female","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Retrospective Studies","methods","pathology","surgery"],"pages":"219-222","volume":"2","issue":"5","id":"a580a9a3-7e7d-3a51-9eaa-12a2058ce12c","abstract":"The purpose of this report was to describe the frequency and morphology of infrarenal aortic aneurysms suitable for endovascular tube graft repair.

There were no complications and already three weeks after the accident the young man was nearly painfree. Avulsion of the anterior superior iliac spine most commonly occur in adolescents. The fracture is often missed and treated as muscle injury or hip pain and therefore received a symptomatical therapy. Later a typical hypertrophic callus formation confirms the avulsion fracture. The avulsion occurs by sudden pull of the sartorius muscle to the anterior superior iliac spine. The pull of the muscle dislocates the loose fragment caudally. In most of the cases a conservative treatment is successful.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/unilateral-apophyseal-fracture-superior-anterior-iliac-cresta-case-report"},{"title":"Efficacy of neo- and adjuvant treatment modalities in gastrointestinal cancer patients.","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"R J","last_name":"Mayer"}],"year":2001,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332 (Print)","pmid":"11771440"},"keywords":["Chemotherapy, Adjuvant","Combined Modality Therapy","Gastrointestinal Neoplasms","Humans","Neoadjuvant Therapy","Neoplasm Staging","Radiotherapy, Adjuvant","Survival Rate","mortality","pathology","therapy"],"pages":"239-242","volume":"7","issue":"6","id":"acc88471-9a70-3640-8511-2f94cff484f4","abstract":"Data which have emerged from randomized clinical trials are inconclusive regarding the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for patients with esophageal cancer.

This retrospective and non-randomized study from a teaching hospital compares short- and long-term results of total (TT) and subtotal thyroidectomies (ST) for this disease. METHODS: From 1987 to 1997, 94 patients were operated for GD. Thirty-three patients underwent a TT (mostly since 1993) and 61 a ST (keeping 4 to 8 grams of thyroid tissue--mean 6 g). All patients had received propylthiouracil and/or neo-mercazole and were in a euthyroid state at the time of surgery; they also took potassium iodide (lugol) for ten days before surgery. RESULTS: There were no deaths. Transient hypocalcemia ({\\textless} 3 months) occurred in 32 patients (15 TT and 17 ST) and persistent hypocalcemia in 8 having had TT. Two patients developed transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy after ST ({\\textless} 3 months). After a median follow-up period of seven years (1-15) with five patients lost to follow-up, 41 patients having had a ST are in a hypothyroid state (73%), thirteen are euthyroid (23%), and two suffered recurrent hyperthyroidism, requiring completion of thyroidectomy. All 33 patients having had TT--with follow-ups averaging two years (0.5-8)--are receiving thyroxin substitution. CONCLUSIONS: There were no instances of persistent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in either group, but persistent hypoparathyroidism occurred more frequently after TT. Long after ST, hypothyroidism developed in nearly three of four cases, whereas euthyroidy was maintained in only one-fourth; recurrent hyperthyroidy was rare.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/short-longterm-results-total-vs-subtotal-thyroidectomies-surgical-treatment-graves-disease"},{"title":"Bone screw osteosynthesis of medial femoral neck fracture in elderly patients","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"C","last_name":"Strauli"},{"first_name":"A","last_name":"Seekamp"},{"first_name":"U","last_name":"Lehmann"},{"first_name":"U","last_name":"Bosch"}],"year":2001,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"isbn":"1023-9332; 1023-9332"},"keywords":["80 and over; Bone Screws; Female; Femoral Neck Fr","Adult; Aged; Aged","Internal/instrumentation; Humans; Male; Middle Ag"],"pages":"167-172","volume":"7","issue":"4","id":"e4326403-e040-33e4-b2a9-04f5c1fc5d4d","abstract":"This study evaluated the complication rate and surgical outcome following cannulated screw fixation of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.

Five-hundred-and-eight patients (28.8%) underwent hepatic resection which was performed with curative intent in 473 patients (26.8%). 30-day mortality in this group was 4.5%, being 2.6% (4 out of 155) since 1990. Significant morbidity was observed in 16% of patients with a decrease to 7% for the last 4 years. A 99.5 percent follow-up until January 1, 1996, was achieved. Excluding operative mortality there are 376 patients with \"potentially curative\" initial liver resection, and 65 corresponding patients with minimal macroscopic (n = 19) or microscopic (n = 46) residual disease. The latter group demonstrated a poor prognosis with median and maximum survival times of 14.8 and 56 months, respectively. Among the 376 patients having potentially curative resection the actuarial five, ten, and twenty year survival was 39 +/- 3, 26 +/- 5 and 21 +/- 13 percent, respectively. Tumor-free survival was 34 +/- 3 percent at 5 years. In the univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with decreased crude survival: Presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p = 0.0001), poor grading of the primary tumor (p = 0.008), synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p = 0.004), satellite metastases (p < 0.0001), an increasing metastasis diameter (p < 0.0001), preoperative CEA elevation (p = 0.0002), a resection margin of less than 1 cm (p = 0.018), extrahepatic disease (p = 0.02), non-anatomical procedures (p = 0.008), and an operative blood loss exceeding 2.000 ml (p = 0.02). With respect to disease-free survival, extrahepatic disease (p = 0.09) failed to achieve statistical significance, while patients with colon cancer and with delayed resection of synchronous metastases did significantly better than those with rectal cancer (p = 0.02) and with a simultaneous procedure (p = 0.04), respectively. Multiplicity and bilobar involvement did not affect prognosis. Similarly, no significant predictive value of an increasing number of metastases (1-3 vs > or = 4) on either overall (p = 0.35) or disease free survival (p = 0.55) was found after a radical excision of all detectable disease. Using Cox's multivariate regression analysis, presence of satellite metastases, anatomical vs non-anatomical approach, primary tumor grade and diameter of the largest metastasis all independently affected both crude and tumor-free survival (p < 0.05). With respect to survival, this was complemented by the margin of clearance (0.05 < p < 0.1), while for disease-free survival primary tumor site and time of metastasis diagnosis had some additional influence. Twenty-six patients with R0-reresection of the liver, and 32 patients with radical excision of extrahepatic recurrent disease had a subsequent 5-year survival of 57 +/- 15 percent and 32 +/- 12 percent, respectively. This confirms the effectiveness of a close follow-up policy.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/surgical-resection-colorectal-liver-metastases-gold-standard-solitary-radically-resectable-lesions"},{"title":"[Multidisciplinary management of hereditary colorectal cancer].","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"C","last_name":"Soravia"},{"first_name":"C","last_name":"Delozier-Blanchet"},{"first_name":"J L","last_name":"Blouin"},{"first_name":"M A","last_name":"Bründler"},{"first_name":"J F","last_name":"Egger"},{"first_name":"P E","last_name":"Queneau"},{"first_name":"A D","last_name":"Roth"},{"first_name":"M C","last_name":"Marti"},{"first_name":"S E","last_name":"Antonarakis"},{"first_name":"P","last_name":"Morel"},{"first_name":"P","last_name":"Hutter"}],"year":2001,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332","pmid":"11407044"},"pages":"99-104","volume":"7","issue":"3","websites":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11407044"],"id":"1683d25d-0cbb-36b6-a53b-1734e1745173","accessed":[2016,7,20],"abstract":"AIM The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and success of multidisciplinary approach for the management of hereditary colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS From November 1998 to November 2000, 32 individuals with putative familial/hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer were investigated for adenomatous polyposis (attenuated or classical familial adenomatous polyposis coli, FAP) or for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Amsterdam criteria (I and II) and Bethesda guidelines were used to select putative HNPCC kindreds. Clinical data including endoscopy, pathological and operative reports as well as family history were collected. Pre- and post-test genetic counseling was offered to at-risk individuals. Genetic testing included microsatellite instability (MSI) and search for germline mutations in the APC, hMSH2 and hMLH1 genes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of hMSH2 and hMLH1 protein expression in tumour samples was also performed. RESULTS 11 APC mutations were characterized, whereas four mutations in HNPCC genes were found in hMSH2 (2) and in hMLH1 (2). MSI and IHC correlated completely for cases with identified pathogenic mutation (100%). CONCLUSION A thorough evaluation and management of hereditary colorectal requires a multidisciplinary approach. Thus, more mutation carriers can be identified and benefit from appropriate genetic counselling, while non-carrier individuals are relieved from unnecessary surveillance.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/multidisciplinary-management-hereditary-colorectal-cancer"},{"title":"Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE)--the Basel experience.","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"F M","last_name":"Haecker"},{"first_name":"J","last_name":"Bielek"},{"first_name":"D","last_name":"von Schweinitz"}],"year":2003,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"isbn":"1023-9332","issn":"1023-9332","pmid":"14725098"},"pages":"289-95","volume":"9","issue":"6","websites":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14725098"],"id":"0c2f8a72-35a2-35a2-b866-cdaa7c357ab4","abstract":"PURPOSE Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) was first reported in 1998 by D. Nuss. This technique has gained wide acceptance during the last 4-5 years. In the meantime, some modifications of the technique have been introduced by different authors. Our retrospective study reports our own experience over the last 36 months and modifications introduced due to a number of complications. METHODS From 3/2000 to 3/2003, 22 patients underwent MIRPE. Patients median age was 15.5 years (10.7 to 20.3 years). Standardised preoperative evaluation included 3D computerised tomography (CT) scan, pulmonary function tests, cardiac evaluation with electrocardiogram and echocardiography, and photo documentation. Indications for operation included at least two of the following: Haller CT index > 3.2, restrictive lung disease, cardiac compression, progression of the deformity and severe psychological alterations. RESULTS In 22 patients (2 girls, 20 boys) undergoing MIRPE procedure, a single bar was used in 21 patients and two bars in one boy. Lateral stabilisers were fixed with non resorbable sutures on both sides. Overall, postoperative complications occurred in six patients (27.3%). In two patients (9.1%) a redo-procedure was necessary due to bar displacement. An additional median skin incision was performed in two patients to elevate the sternum. Pneumothorax or hematothorax in two patients resulted in routine use of a chest tube on both sides. Long-term favourable results were noted in all patients. CONCLUSIONS The MIRPE procedure is an effective method with elegant cosmetic results. Modifications of the original method help to decrease the complication rate and to accelerate acquirement of expertise.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/minimally-invasive-repair-pectus-excavatum-mirpethe-basel-experience"},{"title":"[Surgical treatment of echinococcosis of the liver]","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"W","last_name":"Uhl"},{"first_name":"H","last_name":"Löffler"},{"first_name":"A","last_name":"Zimmermann"},{"first_name":"O","last_name":"Tcholakov"},{"first_name":"B","last_name":"Gloor"},{"first_name":"M W","last_name":"Büchler"}],"year":1999,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332","pmid":"10414184"},"keywords":["Adolescent","Adult","Aged","Animals","Echinococcosis","Echinococcus","Echinococcus: isolation & purification","Female","Hepatic","Hepatic: mortality","Hepatic: pathology","Hepatic: surgery","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Postoperative Complications","Postoperative Complications: mortality"],"pages":"126-32","volume":"5","issue":"3","websites":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10414184"],"month":1,"id":"eb7c8636-d20a-3459-9a3e-7eeb8fdbbc6a","accessed":[2010,7,29],"abstract":"Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease which is most frequently located in the liver.

Axillary lymph node involvement and tumour size are the most important prognostic factors. Restriction of ALND to level I and II (Berg) reduced high morbidity. The increasing proportion of patients with early breast cancer and negative axillary nodes led to a more selective method to avoid unnecessary ALND. The sentinel lymph node (SLN)--the first draining lymph node of a tumour--represents the status of the axilla. A negative SLN prevents from further completion ALND. PATIENTS AND METHODS From 9/97 to 1/99 44 patients with invasive breast cancer underwent a prospective trial of lymphatic mapping with isosulfanblue and/or lymphoscintigraphy with 99m technetium-labelled human colloid. During the operation a hand-held gamma probe was used for detection. The SLN was removed selectively and examined by routine histopathology (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). ALND of level I and II was performed in all patients for correlation. RESULTS The SLN were identified in 41 of 44 patients (93%). 2.4 SLN per patient were harvested, overall 17.6 axillary lymph nodes. Of the 41 patients, 21 patients had positive, 20 patients negative SLN. In the 20 patients with negative SLN only one patient (5%) had metastatic disease on complete dissection (negative predictive value of 95%). In 17 patients with positive axillary lymph nodes 16 were found to have positive SLN, only one SLN was negative (false negative rate of 5.9%). In two of 41 patients micrometastases were detected by IHC. Lymphoscintigraphy revealed drainage to the axilla and internal mammary nodes in two of 28 cases (7%). SUMMARY Our validation study proves the reproducibility and reliability of the SLN procedure. A multidisciplinary approach is indispensable. The SLN procedure has the potency for becoming the selection criterion whether to perform an ALND or not. Multiple sections and IHC staining improve the detection rate of metastatic disease. Ongoing long time investigations will determine the impact on overall survival. Our own data are discussed in an extended review of the literature.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/validation-study-sentinel-lymph-node-sln-method-invasive-breast-carcinoma-personal-data-review-liter-2"},{"title":"[Distal biceps tendon ruptures--experiences with soft tissue preserving reinsertion by bone anchors].","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"F","last_name":"Brunner"},{"first_name":"H","last_name":"Gelpke"},{"first_name":"T","last_name":"Hotz"},{"first_name":"K","last_name":"Käch"}],"year":1999,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332","pmid":"10467875"},"keywords":["Adult","Articular","Articular: physiology","Bone Screws","Elbow","Elbow: injuries","Elbow: pathology","Elbow: surgery","Humans","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Male","Middle Aged","Range of Motion","Rupture","Tendon Injuries","Tendon Injuries: diagnosis","Tendon Injuries: surgery","Treatment Outcome"],"pages":"186-190","volume":"5","issue":"4","websites":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10467875"],"id":"fa2006b5-bc02-3d75-9919-641a7f29094b","abstract":"The repair of the distal biceps tendon rupture with bone anchors achieves excellent results.

In 4 patients, 6 to 12 1/2 years, operated for perforated appendicitis, a fecalith was initially overlooked. This unrecognised fecalith at operation led to an intraabdominal abscess 14 days up to 17 months postoperatively. After laparatomy with extraction of the fecalith, drainage of the abscess and antibiotical therapy all patients attained definitive healing. An appendicolith can escape into the abdominal cavity before or during appendectomy, causing complications. An unrecognised fecalith is a rare cause for intraabdominal abscess formation. Nevertheless in patients with an intraabdominal abscess after appendectomy a thorough radiological search for a fecalith by means of plain abdominal radiograph and abdominal ultrasound is mandatory.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: between 1979 and 1993, 31 consecutive patients with a blunt injury to the popliteal artery were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: 4 patients were in shock on admission from a popliteal artery bleed. One patient died before treatment. Primary amputation of the leg was performed in one patient because of extensive tissue destruction. Arterial reconstruction was performed in the remaining 29 patients: 1 patient died of associated injuries, 5 underwent subsequent limb amputation because of infection (in 2), tissular destruction (in 2) and persistent ischemia (in 1). A neurological deficit (mostly of the peroneal nerve) occurred in 13 patients. Increased ischemic time was noted in 6 patients because of non-optimal management: diagnosis of a popliteal artery occlusion was missed in 2 patients, and a rigid approach resulted in an excessive delay in revascularization in 4 patients. DISCUSSION: even though morbidity of blunt popliteal artery injury is greatly determined by the initial trauma, superimposed ischemia further jeopardizes the outcome. A more expeditive revascularization could be achieved in some patients by performing on-table angiograms, immediate fasciotomy to release tissue hypertension and by proceeding with the vascular repair before orthopedic reconstruction. However, if a complex orthopedic repair must be performed initially because of major instability, indwelling shunts should be inserted in the popliteal vessels to insure limb perfusion. CONCLUSION: it is postulated that a rational plan of management of blunt popliteal artery injury would decrease the adverse effect of ischemia, and would reduce overall morbidity.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/management-blunt-injury-popliteal-artery"},{"title":"[Review of infected total arthroplasties of the hip and knee--apropos of 28 cases].","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"E","last_name":"Weber"},{"first_name":"A","last_name":"Cometta"},{"first_name":"C H","last_name":"Blanc"},{"first_name":"P F","last_name":"Leyvraz"}],"year":2000,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"pmid":"11142158","issn":"1023-9332 (Print)"},"keywords":["Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Hip Prosthesis","Humans","Knee Prosthesis","Male","Middle Aged","Prosthesis Failure","Prosthesis-Related Infections","Radiography","Reoperation","diagnostic imaging","surgery"],"pages":"335-342","volume":"6","issue":"6","id":"4ec1bba8-9f47-3c0d-a630-de8cd2837e42","abstract":"This study is a long-term analysis of a group of patients with infected arthroplasties of the hip or the knee.

The treatments were 14 two-stage replacements of the arthroplasties, 7 simple resections, 5 conservative treatments and 2 one-stage replacements. On follow-up, 25 patients were considered as cured of their infection and 3 as failures. From a functional viewpoint, 9 patients showed no limitation, whereas 19 were limited in the daily activity. Half of the patients had no pain. Radiology showed that 20/26 evaluated patients had no signs of recurrence. Paraclinical examinations are important in the diagnosis of persistent low grade infections, particularly the demonstration of bacteria by pre-surgical sampling (fine needle aspiration, culture from draining sinuses). In spite of the cure of infection, the functional and painful sequellae are often considerable. As a result of our experience, we recommend a two-stage surgical procedure. Only when the general condition of the patient is poor, or when the infection is not under control, would we envisage an alternative procedure (arthrodesis, girdelstone, conservative).","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/review-infected-total-arthroplasties-hip-kneeapropos-28-cases"},{"title":"Lymphatic mapping and sentinel node identification for colorectal cancer.","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"D M","last_name":"Ota"},{"first_name":"K","last_name":"Lin"}],"year":2001,"source":"Swiss surgery = Schweizer Chirurgie = Chirurgie suisse = Chirurgia svizzera","identifiers":{"issn":"1023-9332 (Print)","pmid":"11771443"},"keywords":["Colorectal Neoplasms","Humans","Lymph Nodes","Lymphatic Metastasis","Neoplasm Staging","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Predictive Value of Tests","Prognosis","Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy","Tumor Markers, Biological","analysis","pathology","surgery"],"pages":"252-255","volume":"7","issue":"6","id":"88b0e375-7567-31ad-ac6d-f7a47562b561","abstract":"The primary treatment of resectable CRC is surgical resection.

Meanwhile discussions have begun inside medicine in general about a change of paradigms, ways of thinking, the model of the world. Surgery can even make substantial contributions to this change of paradigms. Surgery for the human machine? Psychosomatic ways of thinking are first seen not applicable for surgery. Substantial anxiety exists to take notice of each other. Three concrete examples from everyday practice in surgery demonstrate, how psychosomatic thinking can change and enrich surgical practice: From the area of indications reflections about appendectomy, from the operative-surgical area the phenomenon of self-destructive behaviour, from the restitutive area experiences in treatment of osteomyelitis. Back to the interpersonal area! Psychosomatics must be recognised as a way of thinking and be integrated as such into surgery. A so-called \"integrated surgery\" will arise.
