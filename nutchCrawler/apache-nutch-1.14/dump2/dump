IP1 Simulating Cosmic Structure Formation , Volker Springel (University of Heidelberg, Germany)
Chair: Ben Moore (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Abstract Numerical simulations on supercomputers play an ever more important role in astrophysics. They have become the tool of choice to predict the non-linear outcome of the initial conditions left behind by the Big Bang, providing crucial tests of cosmological theories. However, the problem of galaxy and star formation confronts us with a staggering multi-physics complexity and an enormous dynamic range that severely challenges existing numerical methods. In my talk, I review current strategies to address these problems, focusing on recent developments in the field such as hierarchical time integration schemes, improved particle- and mesh-based hydrodynamical solvers, and novel parallelization schemes.
Short Biography Volker Springel became professor for Theoretical Astrophysics at Heidelberg University in 2010, where he now leads a research group at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS). Springel previously was a group leader in computational cosmology at the Max-Planck-Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, after working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics in the United States. He received his PhD in 2000 from the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, after studying physics at the University of Tübingen and the University of California, Berkeley.

IP2 The Great Leap , Bjorn Stevens (Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Germany)
Chair: Christoph Schär (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Abstract Increasing computational power and advances in algorithms have made it possible to resolve an ever increasing fraction of the scales of atmospheric motion. While it remains inconceivable to resolve all the relevant scales of motion we are currently in the midst of a great leap across a range of scales that have posed some of the greatest challenges to climate science over the past sixty years. This leap is bringing wholly new insights into the structure of the climate system on both ends of the spectrum of atmospheric motions.
Biography Bjorn Stevens's research blends modeling, theory and field work to understand the role of clouds and moist convection on the climate system.

Co-Authors: Luca Bonaventura (Politecnico di Milano, Italy)
We present an adaptive discretization approach for model equations typical of NWP, which combines the semi-Lagrangian technique with a TR-BDF2 semi-implicit time discretization and with a DG spatial discretization with (arbitrarily high) variable and dynamically adaptive element degree. The resulting method has full second order accuracy in time, is unconditionally stable and can effectively adapt at runtime the number of degrees of freedom employed in each element, in order to balance accuracy and computational cost. Numerical results of classical 2D benchmarks for shallow water equations on the sphere and Euler equations on a vertical slice confirm the potential of the proposed formulation.

There are known scaling issues with the otherwise-successful combination of C-grid finite difference methods on a global latitude-longitude grid. Direct extensions of C-grid methods to quasi-uniform grids have known inadequacies. Mixed finite element methods, recently unified under the label of finite element exterior calculus, provide a way of recovering desirable numerical properties but on arbitrary meshes. After some initial work in 2D, we implemented a method for the automated generation of sophisticated 'tensor-product' finite elements. The use of finite element methods also invites the possibility of high-order approaches, though we are not actively exploring this.

Scalable Dynamic Load Balancing of Detailed Cloud Physics with FD4 ; Matthias Lieber (Technische Universität Dresden, Germany)
Co-Authors:
Load balancing of large-scale scientific simulations is a challenging task. My talk shows how the open source framework FD4 (Four-Dimensional Distributed Dynamic Data structures) enables scalable dynamic load balancing of detailed cloud physics in the atmospheric model COSMO-SPECS+FD4. The concept is based on separating data structures and decomposition such that the cloud physics model can be partitioned independently of the atmospheric model. To increase scalability, a hierarchical space-filling curve partitioning algorithm is used. Benchmarks on a Blue Gene/Q system show the scalability up to 256k ranks. FD4 can also be applied to other multiphase or multiphysics problems.

The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) has undertaken a full port of the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) climate model currently under development at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) and the German Weather Service (DWD). Central to this port is the co-design with MPI-M and DWD developers to ensure that the code changes are minimal and non-intrusive, do not impose any significant changes in CPU performance, and can be incorporated directly into the development trunk. In this talk we present some of the techniques which facilitate this co-design project and initial results indicating that the performance is directly related to the peak memory bandwidth.
Advances in Numerics and Physical Modeling for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
In view of the ever increasing parallelism of supercomputing platforms and the approaching era of exascale computing, high-resolution modeling is becoming a priority for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) numerical modelers. Today's supercomputers require highly scalable numerical methods; high-resolution permits more resolved physical processes. This mini-symposium aims to bringing together scientists from different disciplines who are contributing to the next-generation GFD model development via the definition of advanced numerical methods and more accurate physical schemes. Interest is given to scalable numerics and high-resolution physics modeling such as, but not limited to, LES.

I will present a 'big-data'-based MD technique where QM-accurate information is either located in massive databases or generated on the fly if unavailable, and used to predict atomic forces via Bayesian inference [1]. The approach is efficient as it concentrates QM subroutine calls where/when 'chemically novel' configurations are encountered along the system's trajectory. Interestingly, QM-zone partitioning followed by execution by standard O(N3) QM engines is predicted to be a better option than using O(N) QM methods when dealing with large QM zones in machine learning-augmented QM/MM calculations running on HPC platforms.

A crucial step in understanding the behavior of complex materials is the introduction of coarse-grained order parameters that describe meta-stable states and transitions on the free energy surface, with a simpler, more intuitive representation than using the Cartesian coordinates of all the atoms. I will present sketch-map, a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm loosely based on multidimensional scaling, which obtains automatically such a simplified description, mapping with exquisite detail the stability of different conformations. Applications ranging from polypeptides to small clusters will be presented, demonstrating the potential and transferability of the method.

Compared to many low molecular weight materials soft matter is not that perfectly characterized. E.g. polydispersity directly affects material properties. Furthermore chemical variation, for both synthetic and biological soft matter, is huge. Thus there are two options to provide data repositories, i.e. by experiment or simulation and quantum chemistry or by combination of both. I will present some thoughts of how, mainly based on theoretical work, they might be extended to form a basis of generally applicable data repositories.

Quantum Energy Regression Using Scattering Transforms ; Matthew Hirn (École normale supérieure, France)
Co-Authors: Stéphane Mallat (École normale supérieure, France); Nicolas Poilvert (Pennsylvania State University, USA)
Physical functionals are usually computed as solutions of variational problems or from solutions of partial differential equations, which may require huge computations for complex systems. Quantum chemistry calculations of molecular energies is such an example. We present a novel approach for the regression of quantum mechanical energies based on the scattering transform of an intermediate electron density representation. The scattering transform is a deep convolutional network, composed of iterated wavelet transforms, that possesses appropriate invariant and stability properties for quantum energy regression. Numerical experiments give state of the art accuracy on planar organic molecules.
Big Data Analytics for Novel Materials Discovery
To achieve deeper and novel scientific insight, to decide what new materials should be studied next as most promising novel candidates, and to identify interesting anomalies, the big data generated in computational materials science must be shared and efficient and physically meaningful analytic tools must be developed. The field has evolved in two main directions: constructing large databases of internally consistent materials data and development of advanced, machine-learning based, analysis techniques. Speakers of this symposium will discuss the strong and weak points of the different strategies adopted to perform big-data analytics, towards the discovery of new materials.

Preconditioning Strategies for Multi-parameter Full Waveform Inversion ; Ludovic Métivier (CNRS, France)
Co-Authors: Romain Brossier (University of Grenoble Alpes, France); Stéphane Operto Géoazur (University of Sophia-Antipolis, France); Jean Virieux (University of Grenoble Alpes, France)
Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution seismic imaging method, based on the minimization of the misfit between observed and synthetic data. FWI is now routinely used in seismic exploration, as a velocity-building method. However, the formalism of FWI allows for the simultaneous reconstruction not only of P- and S-wave velocities, but also for parameters such as density, attenuation and anisotropy. This current limitation is due to trade-offs between parameters, making difficult to decipher between them only from seismic data. We propose to review and analyze the issues related to multi-parameter FWI, and propose a preconditioning strategy trying to mitigate these difficulties.

Data Assimilation for Source Encoding Strategies in Full-Waveform Seismic Inversion ; Christian Boehm (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Andreas Fichtner (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Alessandro Lechmann (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Full-Waveform seismic tomography infers the material properties of the Earth based on the observation of seismograms. Since the costs of solving this inverse problem are roughly proportional to the number of seismic events, source-encoding strategies can reduce the computational effort substantially. We exploit statistical properties of a sample average approximation to gradually incorporate more information into the problem formulation and to update the weights of the encoded sources. This alternates with a Newton-type method based on mini-batch Hessian approximations to update the material model.

Full-waveform inversion (FWI) optimizes subsurface model estimates to derive high-fidelity geological models. A mathematically sound method is described for selecting the part of the geological parameters that is best identifiable from the seismic acquisition geometry. This is combined with either interior-point or sequential quadratic programming methods for performing FWI for the subset of parameters that have been characterized as identifiable. Numerical results are presented on several examples of increased complexity.

The Comprehensive Seismic Earth Model (CSEM) is a 3D multi-scale visco-elastic model of Earth's interior. Designed to combat scaling issues in seismic inversion, the CSEM incorporates models generated from a variety of forward problem solvers, on a variety of spatial scales. Approaching global-scale seismic inversion in this manner allows us to exploit the benefits of both high resolution numerical techniques, such as full waveform inversion via the spectral element method, and more classical inversion techniques, such as traveltime tomography, where each may contribute model updates within their specific regimes of validity.
Data Assimilation and Predictive Models in the Earth Sciences
Nearly all fields in the Earth sciences combine numerical models and data measurements to infer unknown parameters or to predict the future state of a dynamical system. With the widespread availability of massively parallel supercomputers researchers can continually increase both the resolution and the physical complexity within their numerical models. By combining observations and model simulations, data assimilation offers a powerful tool to iteratively solve these systems, which may be highly nonlinear with extremely large numbers of unknowns. This minisymposium aims at discussing examples from various Earth science applications, including geodynamics, geomagnetism and seismic imaging.

The challenge of the modeling and simulation of blood flow dynamics in the heart and in the aortic root includes at least the following components: large deformations of the computational domain, opening and closing of the valves, interaction with the cardiac muscle, and changing flow regime. In this talk we focus mainly on the flow components. We first look at the flow in an idealized left ventricle. The flow is discretized by finite elements and stabilized by the variational multiscale method. The valve is modeled by a zero-dimensional resistance model. We then present a three-dimensional model for the leaflets. We conclude by showing simulations of blood flow in the aortic root.

I will present an integrated model of mitral valve (MV) coupled with the left ventricle (LV) by using an immersed boundary method along with a finite element description of valvular and myocardial mechanics. The model is derived from clinical images and takes into account of the important valvular features, left ventricular contraction, nonlinear soft tissue mechanics, fluid structure interaction, and the MV-LV interaction. The integrated MV and LV model can simulate the cardiac function both in diastole and systole. Further work is required to ensure that the highly complex valvular-ventricular interaction, and the fluid-structure interaction, can be reliably represented.

Furthermore, we discuss advancements in parallelized implementation of platelet activation models into numerical simulations to quantify the probability of blood clot formation in heart valves. We present the results of our recent fluid-structure interaction simulations, and discuss the flow physics. Finally, we discuss our future plans to advance FSI simulations.

HPC Framework for Aortic Valve Simulation with Hybrid Discretization for Fluid and Soft Tissue ; Dominik Obrist (University of Bern, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Barna Becsek (University of Bern, Switzerland)
The numerical simulation of aortic valves is a multi-physics problem involving large deformations of soft tissue and transient vortical flow fields. Whereas soft tissue is most appropriately discretized on unstructured meshes in Lagrangian formulation, the three-dimensional flow field is discretized on a structured Cartesian grid to obtain an efficient implementation on modern HPC platforms. The tissue dynamics on the unstructured mesh and the flow on the structured grid are coupled with the immersed boundary method. The parallelization of such a hybrid discretization approach raises interesting questions with respect to data locality and load balancing under a domain decomposition paradigm.
Fluid-Structure Interaction in the Cardiovascular System
The mechanical interaction between blood and soft tissue is a central mechanism in the cardiovascular system (e.g. heart valve dynamics, myocardial motion). A detailed understanding of these processes is the basis for the development of diagnostic methods, therapeutic devices and prostheses. To this end, large fluid-structure problems have to be solved accurately and efficiently on high-performance computing platforms with sophisticated numerical methods and with parallelization paradigms, which comply with large structural deformations and a range of inherent time scales. This minisymposium presents the work of leading groups in this field.

Big data in life science is experiencing the perfect storm: The volume is increasing exponentially with accelerating speed, the variety of data ranges from multi-omics information to lifestyle measures with the help of mobile devices backed by cloud infrastructures. State of the art analytical methods are generally limited by computational approaches. The researcher is forced to limit their investigation to selected data rather than exhaustively mining the data. We have demonstrated that supercomputing methodologies enables discovery beyond traditional methods. Add cognitive computing to supercomputing and the perfect storm can be conquered.

Linking conditions occurring in a respiratory tract with those in the exposure systems requires detailed understanding of flow and deposition of aerosols. The presentation will showcase the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics in simulating flow in a human lung airway model and outlines opportunities for leveraging simulated data to develop well-designed in-vitro respiratory toxicology experiments that have the potential to allow in-vitro to in-vivo exposure extrapolations.
HPC in Systems Biology
Systems Biology is a highly multidisciplinary approach to decoding life that combines computational with experimental methods to elucidate biological mechanisms and their dynamic behavior at all levels of biological organization. Systems Biology enables new approaches in pharmacology, toxicology, diagnostics, as well as drug development. The presentations will exemplify how computational Systems Biology can enable the understanding of biological systems both at the genomic and at the structural level, how mechanistic understanding is likely to change product risk assessment and how HPC will turn Big Data into knowledge about biological systems.

Continuum solvation models are nowadays among the most popular tools in computational chemistry to include the effects of the chemical environment in the description of a molecular property or process. The strength of these models is their simplicity of use and cost-effectiveness. Continuum solvation models have been used together with both classical molecular mechanics (MM), quantum mechanics (QM) and hybrid (QM/MM) levels of theory to describe the solute. In this talk, I will present the basics of an efficient, parallel, linear scaling implementation of the conductor-like screening model (COSMO), based on a domain decomposition algorithm adapted to the integral formulation of the problem.

We have developed a novel polarizable force field, called the Gaussian Electrostatic Model (GEM). GEM is designed to reproduce each term of the QM intermolecular interaction by fitting electronic densities using Hermite Gaussians. GEM enables the evaluation of intermolecular interactions for molecular systems with errors below chemical accuracy for each component, and provides a novel procedure to obtain distributed multipoles (GEM--DM). The use of Hermite Gaussian result in the need to evaluate a large number of two center (Coulomb and overlap) integrals. I will discuss the extension of two approximate Ewald methods (PME and FFP) to evaluate these integrals and timings for H2O.

Co-Authors:
I will present multiscale-in-time strategies to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations. Starting from a metastable stochastic process, the idea is to use the underlying jump process between metastable states in order to accelerate exit events in a statistically consistent way. For example, it is possible to parallelize in time the integration of the dynamics. These ideas have been proposed A.F. Voter in the nineties, and their mathematical foundations have been recently understood thanks to the notion of quasi stationary distribution.
Mathematical Aspects of Multi-Scale Methods in Computational Chemistry
In the last decades, multi-scale strategies have been the object of a wide and fruitful development. Such methodologies, including QM/MM methods and QM/Continuum methods, allow to model different chemical parts with different accuracies in the description of a molecular system. For strongly inhomogeneous systems, as it is the case for biological environments, such techniques are extremely important resulting in a large variety of real-world applications at an affordable computational price. The scope of this mini-symposium is to bring chemists and mathematicians working on the methodological development of such methods together and foster this inter-disciplinary research field.

Inelastic strain, which is associated to the induced microseismicity observed in CO2 injection sites like Weyburn or In Salah, is likely to occur in CO2 storage sites. Furthermore, CO2 will reach the storage formation at a colder temperature than the rock, which will induce a thermal stress reduction. We model non-isothermal injection of CO2 in a deep saline formation using the fully coupled finite element code CODE_BRIGHT. We find that despite inelastic strain is likely to occur in the cooled region around the injection well, fracture propagation does not extend into the caprock in the normal faulting stress regime simulated in this study.

Due to the increase in renewable energies in the electricity market, hydraulic power plants have to run at off-design operating points. For Francis turbines, this leads to the formation of a vortex rope known to promote cavitation surge. If the flow discharge is higher than the nominal one, an axisymmetric cavitation vortex rope develops in the draft tube cone. Such a vortex rope leads to high pressure fluctuations that interact with the entire power plant and limit the range of operating points. To better understand the physics of the phenomenon and to provide input to 1D models, two-phase 3D CFD calculations are performed and compared with experimental data

Challenges of Simulating Geothermal Reservoir Processes ; Julian Mindel (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Thomas Driesner (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Future geothermal power production in Switzerland requires circulating water through deep (~ 5km), fractured rock masses at temperatures exceeding 180°C. The extreme conditions massively limit direct, in situ observation and steering of reservoir processes, making numerical simulation a key research and development technology. The biggest challenges are a combination of complex but poorly know geometries (thin, irregular fracture networks in a large rock mass) and strongly coupled, non-linear processes (thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical interactions). This contribution outlines the goals and challenges of numerical code development in the SCCER-SoE and related initiatives.

A New Volcanic Hydrothermal System in Java; the Lusi Mud Eruption and Aftermath ; Stephen Miller (University of Neuchatel, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Maïté Faubert (University of Neuchatel, Switzerland); Reza Sohrabi (University of Neuchatel, Switzerland)
In 2006 a magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in Yogyakarta on the island of Java. This relatively shallow earthquake resulted in 20,000 deaths and widespread destruction of the city. About 48 hours later, in the town of Sidoarjo about 250 km from the earthquake epicentre, mud began to spill out onto the surface and Lusi was born. Eruption rates peaked at 180,000 cubic meters of mud per day, and continues today as a vigorous geyser system, with geochemistry studies showing that is a geologic rarity of a newborn tectonic-scale hydrothermal system linked to the nearby volcano complex. We are modelling this system to gain insight of its workings and the possible exploitation of geothermal energy.

Parallel programming with low-level interfaces has been the most viable choice in scientific computing for a long time. In such models, different parallelisms require different parallel programming interfaces, e.g., message passing for parallelism across nodes, threading for intra-node parallelism, and vector processing for SIMD and GPUs. Often applications are confronted with these multiple interfaces to fully exploit the current and future large-scale machines. We present our work toward higher-level programming models, allowing for a single program to run on different parallel platforms without much human intervention, and at the same time to achieve close to hand-tuned performance.

Large-scale eigenvalue problems arise in wide variety of applications such as nano-scale materials simulation, vibration analysis of automobiles, big data analysis, etc, and high performance solvers are required to exploit distributed parallel computing environments. In this talk, we present a contour-integral based parallel eigensolver for interior eigenvalue problems. This method has a good parallel scalability according to a hierarchical structure of the method. We also present some efficient implementations of the method for large-scale simulations. We show performance evaluations on state-of-art supercomputers with some applications.

We have been developing an open source system software, ADVENTURE, which is a general-purpose parallel finite element analysis system and can simulate a large scale analysis model with supercomputer like K-computer. In the system, HDDM (hierarchical domain decomposition method), which is a very effective technique to large-scale analysis, was developed. The aim of this project is to develop a numerical library based on HDDM that is extended to pre and post processing parts, including mesh generation and visualization of large-scale data, for the Post Petascale simulation.
Scientific Libraries/Frameworks in Japan for Future HPC Systems
Reliable software is the key technology for future HPC systems. In 2010, 'Development of System Software Technologies for Post-Peta Scale HPC (Post-Peta CREST)' was initiated by the Japan Science & Technology Agency. It aims at developing software exploiting maximum efficiency and reliability on future HPC systems in late 2010s. It includes 14 projects, which cover a wide range of research areas in software for HPC, such as system software, programming languages, compilers, numerical libraries, and application frameworks. This minisymposium offers an overview on recent activities of four projects in Post-Peta CREST related to scientific computing, and discusses future international/interdisciplinary collaborations.

Co-Authors: Colin Cotter (Imperial College London, United Kingdom); Jemma Shipton (Imperial College London, United Kingdom); Lawrence Mitchell (Imperial College London, United Kingdom); David A Ham (Imperial College London, United Kingdom); Andrew McRae (Imperial College London, United Kingdom)
A vertical slice model is developed for the Euler-Boussinesq equations with a constant temperature gradient in the y-direction (the Eady-Boussinesq model). The model is a solution of the full 3D equations with no variation normal to the slice, which is an idealized problem used to study the formation and subsequent evolution of weather fronts. Mixed FEM discretizations on an extruded mesh are performed using Firedrake, a high-level Python framework for the portable solution of PDEs on unstructured meshes. I will discuss the details of the vertical slice model implementations and the preliminary results obtained through test simulations developed to implement the modelling of fronts.

This talk will discuss recent developments in stabilized finite element approximations using nonlinear viscosity methods. The regularization terms are constructed by the residual of the system or entropy equations. The method is successfully applied to compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and variable density flows in two and three space dimensions. Then we discuss about maximum principle preserving continuous finite element schemes for scalar conservation laws. The new method does not require any a priori knowledge of quantities like local wave-speed, proportionality constant, or local mesh-size and it is independent of the cell type.

With increasing compute power, the simulation of multi-physics gains more and more popularity. At the same time, a flexible software development process including existing single-physics codes becomes a necessity to cope with the overall complexity. preCICE is an open-source library to surface-couple single-physics codes. Its high-level API allows to write adapters for single-physics codes in 30 lines. Afterwards various codes can be coupled in a nearly plug-and-play manner. preCICE offers methods for interpolation, means for parallel communication, and sophisticated fix-point acceleration schemes. In this talk, we present our efforts and tests on the parallel efficiency of preCICE.

Preconditioned Variational Multiscale Stabilization (PVMS) for Low Mach Flows ; Margarida Moragues Ginard (Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain)
Co-Authors: Guillaume Houzeaux (Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain); Mariano Vázquez (Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain)
In this work we present an implicit scheme for solving the Navier-Stokes equations at Low Mach regimes. The method can cope efficiently with both stiffness and numerical instabilities thanks to the following procedure. A local preconditioner is applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. Next, the preconditioned local system is discretized according to the Variational Multiscale Stabilization (VMS) method. Finally, a monolithic implicit Jacobi (i.e. fixed point) scheme is applied, which, in turn, uses an algebraic diagonal preconditioner on a GMRES iterative solver. The scheme is assessed on large-scale 3D problems, particularly on its accuracy, convergence and parallel efficiency.
Advances in Numerics and Physical Modeling for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
In view of the ever increasing parallelism of supercomputing platforms and the approaching era of exascale computing, high-resolution modeling is becoming a priority for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) numerical modelers. Today's supercomputers require highly scalable numerical methods; high-resolution permits more resolved physical processes. This mini-symposium aims to bringing together scientists from different disciplines who are contributing to the next-generation GFD model development via the definition of advanced numerical methods and more accurate physical schemes. Interest is given to scalable numerics and high-resolution physics modeling such as, but not limited to, LES.

Simulating thermal transport in nanostructures at atomistic level often requires the use of large-scale models, thus making it necessary to recur to empirical potentials. However, systems with complex chemistry, such as materials for phase change memories (PCM) and advanced thermoelectrics (TE), are poorly described by standard potentials. Here we propose an alternative approach to compute phonon properties and the thermal conductivity of nanostructures, which makes use of neural network potentials fitted on a large database of density functional theory calculation. We demonstrate its application on GeTe nanostructures for PCM and on nanostructured Ge-Mn alloys for TE application.

The properties of any material are, on some level, a function of its internal structure making an understanding of structure key to the discovery process. We use a simple model for particles that attract at long range and repel at short to probe possible structures over a wide range of parameters and stoichiometries. In exploring their energy landscapes we populate a schemaless, MongoDB, database with over 20M entries, many more than current databases populated from experiment or electronic structure calculations. We discuss some challenges of performing local and global analysis over such a large dataset and detail some interesting finds including never before seen structures.

Essentially every new commercial product depends on new or improved materials. To identify such materials, computational approaches are increasingly employed, with millions of CPU hours spent every day and an enormous amount of data created. The goal of the Novel Materials Discovery (NoMaD) Project is not boosting more high-throughput calculations. The issue of NoMaD is: What to do with the data? In this talk, I will introduce the NoMaD Repository (https://nomad-repository.eu) that was established to host, organize, and share materials data, and I will demonstrate an example how big-data analytics based on statistical-learning approaches can lead to new insight into materials properties.
Big Data Analytics for Novel Materials Discovery
To achieve deeper and novel scientific insight, to decide what new materials should be studied next as most promising novel candidates, and to identify interesting anomalies, the big data generated in computational materials science must be shared and efficient and physically meaningful analytic tools must be developed. The field has evolved in two main directions: constructing large databases of internally consistent materials data and development of advanced, machine-learning based, analysis techniques. Speakers of this symposium will discuss the strong and weak points of the different strategies adopted to perform big-data analytics, towards the discovery of new materials.

Present geophysical, geochemical, and geodetic observations together with geological information provide a clue to understanding dynamics of the Earth interior in the past. Assimilation of present observations allows to constrain mantle temperature/composition and flow in the past using dynamical models. Quantitative tools are required to assimilate the data and hence to solve inverse retrospective problems in geodynamics. The basic inversion methods (adjoint and quasi-reversibility) including the methodologies uncertainties and requirements for HPC, and two case studies related to mantle/lithosphere dynamics and to a volcanic lava flow will be presented and discussed.

Data assimilation becomes suitable when the observations are sufficient in number and accurate enough, and if the forward model contains sufficient complexity to necessary for predictions. When it comes to reconstructing convection in the Earth's mantle, data assimilation raises questions for both observations and models. I will review inverse methods used so far, for which seismic tomography is central, and present another angle for data assimilation: using tectonic data as the data to match. I will describe preliminaries and present a sequential data assimilation scheme, and a variational data assimilation scheme, both using tectonic information as the data to match.

Assimilating geomagnetic data in numerical models of Earth's core dynamics is a challenging problem, since the information contained in the geomagnetic record is intrinsically restricted to the large scales of the poloidal geomagnetic field at the core-mantle boundary. After a general introduction on terrestrial magnetism and the observation of Earth's magnetic field, I will report more specifically on recent efforts carried out to investigate the feasibility of resorting to three-dimensional, buoyancy-driven, numerical dynamo models for geomagnetic data assimilation practice. For this symposium, I will discuss in particular the computational cost associated with this exercise.

Ensemble data assimilation techniques are of rapidly growing importance. Ensemble techniques allow to describe and forecast uncertainty of the analysis, but they also improve the assimilation result itself, by allowing estimates of the covariance or, more general, the prior and posterior probability distribution of atmospheric states. In our talk, we will first give a survey about recent activities of the German Meteorological Service DWD. Then, we present recent work on the further development of the ensemble data assimilation towards a particle filter for large-scale atmospheric systems, which keeps the advantages of the LETKF, but overcomes some of its limitations.
Data Assimilation and Predictive Models in the Earth Sciences
Nearly all fields in the Earth sciences combine numerical models and data measurements to infer unknown parameters or to predict the future state of a dynamical system. With the widespread availability of massively parallel supercomputers researchers can continually increase both the resolution and the physical complexity within their numerical models. By combining observations and model simulations, data assimilation offers a powerful tool to iteratively solve these systems, which may be highly nonlinear with extremely large numbers of unknowns. This minisymposium aims at discussing examples from various Earth science applications, including geodynamics, geomagnetism and seismic imaging.

Hierarchical tensor formats and tensor trains introduced recently in numerical analysis have the same parametrization as tree tensor networks and matrix product states. These representations offer stable and robust approximation of high-order tensors and multi-variate functions by a low order cost. For many high dimensional problems, including many body quantum mechanics, uncertainty quantification etc., this approach has a certain potential to circumvent from the curse of dimensionality. For numerical computations, the groundstate computation can be cast into optimization problems constraint by restricting to set of d tensors of bounded multilinear ranks.
Mathematical Aspects of Multi-Scale Methods in Computational Chemistry
In the last decades, multi-scale strategies have been the object of a wide and fruitful development. Such methodologies, including QM/MM methods and QM/Continuum methods, allow to model different chemical parts with different accuracies in the description of a molecular system. For strongly inhomogeneous systems, as it is the case for biological environments, such techniques are extremely important resulting in a large variety of real-world applications at an affordable computational price. The scope of this mini-symposium is to bring chemists and mathematicians working on the methodological development of such methods together and foster this inter-disciplinary research field.

The geothermal community is challenged by the Energy Strategy 2050 goal to uncover the potential of renewable energy resources in Switzerland. To this end we implement a novel finite element based simulation tool for rock and fluid physics. It efficiently couples the dominant processes in the subsurface, such as fracture nucleation and growth using continuum mechanics, anisotropic multiphase fluid flow and heat transfer to provide a deeper understanding. We aim at state of the art performance by using massively parallel tools and modern accelerator techniques. We present first results from 3D fully coupled THM-simulations and evaluate the performance from a series of benchmark simulations.

Prediction of Elastostatic Friction for Rock-Like Surfaces with FEM ; Alessandro Rigazzi (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Rolf Krause (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
We present the results of our recent work, in which we apply the Finite Element Method to study the frictional forces resulting from the elastostatic interactions of surface asperities. To do this, we generate several self-affine rough surfaces that are statistically similar to rock surfaces. Such surfaces are used as rigid obstacles onto which an elastic smooth cube is pushed and sheared to measure the maximal resistance opposed by the asperities. The contact problem gives rise to a huge nonsmooth system of equations. We solve this system with a solver based on our nonsmooth multigrid algorithm of optimal complexity for which we investigate scaling properties.

To enable the large-scale exploitation of deep geothermal energy for electricity generation in Switzerland, solutions must be found for two fundamental and coupled problems: (1) How to create an efficient heat exchanger in the hot underground that can produce energy for decades and (2) at the same time keeping the risk posed by induced earthquakes to acceptable levels' Numerical simulations of different complexity and physical detail are currently being developed for an Advanced Traffic Light System (ATLS) to predict the risk of in induces earthquakes in real-time. This contribution presents developments of the induced seismicity prediction codes towards high performance computing.

Silt Erosion Simulation Using Finite Volume Particle Method ; Ebrahim Jahanbakhsh (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
Silt erosion is a destructive phenomenon that may occur in hydropower plants. This work presents a new erosion prediction model in which, fluid flow and solid deformation equations are discretized by Finite Volume Particle Method (FVPM), and silt contact forces are calculated according to Hertz contact theory. FVPM is a meshless method which includes many of the desirable features of the mesh-based finite volume method. To obtain a more accurate and robust model, a new FVPM formulation is presented in which particle interaction integrals are evaluated exactly and efficiently. To validate the new silt erosion model, 2D and 3D erosion cases are simulated and compared with experimental data.

Programming models play a crucial role in providing the necessary tools to express locality and minimize data movement, while also abstracting complexity from programmers. Unfortunately, existing compute-centric programming environments provide few abstractions to manage data movement and locality, and rely on a large shared cache to virtualize data movement. We propose three programming abstractions, tiles, layout and loop traversal that address data locality and increased parallelism on emerging parallel computing systems. The TiDA library implements these abstractions in the data structures through domain decomposition and provides performance portable codes.

Using Abstractions in Heterogeneous Architectures for Scalable Thermal Radiation Calculations with AMR and the Uintah Framework ; Martin Berzins (University of Utah, USA)
Co-Authors:
The use of abstractions in achieving performance portability for challenging petascale and beyond calculations is considered in the context of the Uintah framework applied to an engineering design study with one trillion variables that concerns a large 6000 cubic M clean coal-boiler currently under design for power generation. The role of task-based abstractions, runtime systems and portable execution layers such as Kokkos will be explored on heterogenous architectures consisting of CPUs GPUs and Xeon Phis. The success of this approach will be demonstrated through scalability results involving the most challenging part of the calculation involving a thermal radiation calculation that coupled all variables.

Co-Authors: Roland Schulz (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA); Teemu Murtola (Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden); Berk Hess (Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden); Erik Lindahl (Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden)
Scientists' computing resources are often both scarce and expensive, so high absolute performance is an ongoing key development objective for the GROMACS molecular simulation package. The increasingly wide range and heterogeneity of HPC hardware adds considerably to this challenge, and doubly so when such high portability is also required. It is critical to choose algorithms that match the hardware well. It is also necessary to implement them via abstractions appropriate to the computational task at hand, if we are to do so for reasonable development costs. This talk will discuss recent work in GROMACS that lifts the abstraction level to permit ongoing high performance and high portability.

Co-Authors: Tobias Gysi (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Oliver Fuhrer (MeteoSwiss, Switzerland); Thomas C. Schulthess (CSCS / ETH Zurich, Switzerland / Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA)
Regional weather and climate models typically solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) equations using compact stencils on structured grids. STELLA (Stencil Loop Language) is a DSL written in C++ for such stencil computations. It abstracts the underlying programming models and optimization techniques (loop tiling, loop fusion) for multiple hardware architectures. The STELLA language allows to describe stencils with a unique source code in a concise way, close to the mathematical description of the PDEs. We present the STELLA syntax and the performance results achieved for the dynamical core of an important community code (COSMO) for GPU (5.8x speedup) and CPU (1.8x speedup).
Abstractions Interplay in Domain Frameworks to Tackle Heterogeneity
Current generation of domain frameworks have componentization and composability implemented in a stable and portable programming model as their primary abstractions. As platforms began to become heterogeneous some domain frameworks added abstractions to tackle the performance-portability trade-offs, for which the current best practices are no longer adequate. However, there is a growing separation between the shortening life-cycles for future programming models and the life-cycle of a community software framework. This minisymposium seeks to collect and document the abstraction-lifting efforts of multiphysics frameworks with a hope of starting the discussion for closing this gap.

Computational science is becoming the third pillar of science. Unfortunately, economics still largely relies on only two pillars - theory and observations. This can change but only after identifying the mathematical and computational methods that match the needs of economic modeling. I will point to the unique features of economics modeling, and illustrate how a combination of computational tools can be used to address a policy issue in the area of climate change.

Does it pay to get a Reverse Mortgage? ; Valentina Michelangeli (Bank of Italy, Italy)
Co-Authors:
This paper uses data on single households from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to study the economic gains or losses associated with reverse mortgages. These data are examined within a dynamic structural life-cycle model featuring consumption, housing, and mobility decisions with uncertainty about both life span and mobility. I develop and apply new methods for solution and estimation based on a combination of four state-of-the-art mathematical programming tools. I find that reverse mortgages provide liquidity and a form of longevity insurance; however, moving becomes a risky proposition.

DYNARE, a Toolbox for Solving and Estimating DSGE Models ; Michel Juillard (Banque de France, France)
Co-Authors:
Dynare is a software tool to solve, simulate and estimate dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. This requires heavy use of numerical methods: such as solving large sparse complementarity problems, function approximation with the perturbation approach or MCMC simulation of the posterior density. Dynare rests on a strict separation of the specification of a particular model and the use of standard software tools implied the development of a specificmodeling language. The numerical routines are provided as a Matlab/Octave toolbox. Dynare is open source so as to make used algorithms transparent. Challenges ahead include occasionally binding constraints and large shocks.
Emerging Applications of Computation in Economics
Clearly, the world economy is an extremely complex system. Even when modeling only the most relevant features of a small part of this system, one easily ends up with a large and intricate formal structure. A further complication stems from the fact that human beings choose their actions based on expectations about an uncertain future. This feedback from the future makes economic modeling particularly difficult. This symposium provides an overview of recent developments in how state-of-the art computational economical modeling tackles these issues in the fields of macroeconomics, optimal taxation, game theory, climate change, and growth models.

Co-Authors:
I present the Julia implementation of GlaDS, a Glacier Drainage System model. It simulates the water flow at the ice-bedrock interface underneath a glacier or ice sheet, both in a channelized and a diffusive macro-porous system. Its most innovative feature is that the strictly 1D channel equations are embedded into the 2D model-domain by simulating them on the edges of the numerical grid. The equations are a non-linear reaction-diffusion equation coupled to two local ODEs. The model uses finite elements combined with a Rosenbrock-W time stepper. I will review some of the code in detail and highlight Julia specific implementation strategies, such as algebraic datatypes and multiple dispatch.

We present scalable algebraic modeling software, StochJuMP, for stochastic optimization as applied to power grid economic dispatch. It enables the user to express the problem in a high-level algebraic format with minimal boiler-plate and allows efficient parallel model instantiation across nodes and efficient data localization. Computational results on up to 2048 cores of the Blues cluster of Argonne National Laboraratory are presented showing that the model construction is both efficient and scalable. StochJuMP is configured with the parallel interior-point solver PIPS-IPM but is sufficiently generic to allow straightforward adaptation to other solvers.

Many problems in earth science involve with the solution of inverse problems on very large domains and with multiple sources and frequency. Solving such problems was considered to be impossible until recently. In this talk we explore algorithmic and software development that enable the solution of these problems. First, we explore the use of adaptive mesh refinement coupled with the use of direct solvers. Second, we discuss the use of stochastic programming techniques and finally we discuss the parallelization of the algorithm using Julia We use the controlled source EM as a model problem and demonstrate how it can be solved using the above techniques

Distributed and Parallel Algorithms for PDE Constrained Optimization in Julia ; Lars Ruthotto (Emory University, USA)
Co-Authors: Eldad Haber (University of British Columbia, Canada)
This talk presents a Julia framework for the solution of large-scale PDE constrained optimization problems. It is based on a discretize-then-optimize approach, uses a (projected) Gauss-Newton method, and provides interfaces state-of-the-art linear solvers (both explicit and iterative). The framework uses Julia's potential for parallel and distributed computation. Being written in a dynamic language, it is easily extendable and yet fast as it will be outlined for a large electromagnetic test problem.
Large-Scale Scientific Computing with Julia
Julia is a new and emerging dynamic high-level programming language designed for high performance computing. Julia enables rapid development of expressive and easily extensible code and therefore becomes increasingly popular in science and engineering. It overcomes some limitations often associated with established dynamic languages, most importantly, large computational overhead and imperfect scaling on parallel computers. This mini symposium contains examples that outline Julia's potential for the solution of large-scale real-world problems.

Advection of Material Interfaces via a Two-Way Particle Level Set Approach , Henri Samuel (CNRS, France)
Co-authors:
Level set interface tracking is a powerful approach consisting in advecting a smooth function (often taken as the signed distance to the interface) and in reinitializing it permanently to maintain this convenient property. I have recently shown that replacing the standard one-way advection by a two-way wave equation, reduces considerably both the associated errors and complexity. To reduce the erroneous displacements during the reinitialization step, I have now combined this two-way Eulerian advection with Lagrangian particles, as in [Enright et al., JCP, 183, 2002]. Tests reveal a further order-of-magnitude reduction in mass error, making this new hybrid method very competitive.

Hybrid supercomputers offer attractive performance per Watt, yet require care to avoid communication-related bottlenecks. We investigate 'heavy smoothing' with a multigrid preconditioner, using aggressive coarsening with accelerator-enabled smoothing to reduce communication. This maintains scalability and admits a tradeoff between local work and non-local communication. We examine local polynomial smoothing as well as a recently-developed fine-grained ILU decomposition. As part of the GeoPC PASC project, we present portable software contributions within ViennaCL, PETSc, and pTatin3d and results applied to ill-conditioned linear systems from lithospheric dynamics.

We rigorously evaluate the applicability of two Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin methods, namely the Nonsymmetric and Symmetric Interior Penalty methods, to variable viscosity Stokes problems. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are less restrictive regarding the construction of inf-sup stable discretizations of velocity and pressure. In addition, the respective inf-sup constants are insensitive to the element aspect ratio. To date, DG methods have not been extensively used for the considered geodynamic applications. Our numerical tests examine the stability, accuracy and robustness of the methods for cases with both smooth and discontinuous coefficients.

Recent advances in regional and global-scale seismic inversions move towards full-waveform inversions which require accurate simulations of seismic wave propagation in complex 3D media, providing access to the full 3D seismic wavefields. We incorporate a code generation tool BOAST into an existing spectral-element code package to use meta-programming of computational kernels and generate optimized source code for both CUDA and OpenCL hardware accelerators. We show here applications of forward and adjoint seismic wave propagation on CUDA/OpenCL GPUs, validating results and comparing performances for different simulations and hardware usages.

Co-authors: Salah Faroughi (GeorgiaTech, USA); Christian Huber (GergiaTech, USA); Olivier Bachmann (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Natural porous-media, as crystal-rich magma chambers, can display change in porosities (e.g. layered/stratified environment generated by settling and compaction of solid particles). In this poster, we investigate the fate of a buoyant, low-viscosity and non-wetting fluid injected in a porous medium saturated with a more viscous fluid that opens in a solid-free environment. We argue for this existence of a counter-intuitive process whereby the upward migration of the buoyant fluid is more efficient in low-permeability region (i.e. the porous medium). We investigate this scenario using pore-scale numerical calculations based on the lattice Boltzmann technique and laboratory experiments.

Large-Scale Geo-Electromagnetic Modeling with Adaptive High-Order FEM , Alexander Grayver (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

Electromagnetic methods of geophysics aim at studying the subsurface electrical conductivity distribution, and typically require solution of a large number of problems derived from Maxwell's equations. This study investigates the use of adaptive high-order finite elements (FE) to discretize these problems in large-scale parallel settings. We present a new scalable algorithm for solving the resulting systems, based on optimal block-diagonal and auxiliary-space preconditioning. A particular advantage of our solver is that it can handle arbitrarily high-order FE on unstructured and non-conforming locally refined meshes. The meshes are refined by using efficient goal-oriented error estimator.

The 'Comprehensive Earth Model' (CEM) is a solver-independent seismic multi-scale model of the global distribution of density and visco-elastic parameters. Constructed from a locally-refined finite-element mesh, the model attempts to represent the Earth on all seismically accessible scales, with contributions from various inversion techniques. We report on the current state of the model, along with the results of a global scale full-waveform inversion, which makes use of the GPU-accelerated spectral-element code SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.

The Nvidia GPU chip architecture sets new challenges for High Performance Computing (HPC). In order to exploit the large number of Cuda cores optimally, new numerical applications need to be designed. We propose a HPC poromechanical solver that runs on massively parallel multi GPU platforms, such the Cray XC30 Piz Daint, at CSCS. We performed successful preliminary runs on the Cray XC30 Piz Daint at CSCS, and observed linear scaling of our application from 1 to 2048 GPU nodes. The use of supercomputers allowed us to capture the expected nonlinear waves, which results in localized fluid flow through high porosity pathways.

We present several numerical approaches investigated within the FP7-funded Exa2Green project to optimize the energy footprint and performance of the model system. This effort utilizes evolving COSMO optimizations within the PASC initiative. Furthermore, algorithmic changes demonstrated in the PRACE 2IP WP8 and an accelerated version of the Kinetics PreProcessor are used to improve the integration of chemical kinetics and thus lower energy requirements and computational cost of the gas phase chemistry model.

Ensemble Kalman Particle Filter for Convective Scale Data Assimilation , Sylvain Robert (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Hans Rudolph Künsch (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
The Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) is the state of the art algorithm for data assimilation in weather forecasting. However, because it implicitly assumes the background distribution to be Gaussian, there is potential for improvement on the convective scale, where non-Gaussian features are present. We propose new algorithms which combine the LETKF with the Particle Filter in a way that maintains scalability and sample diversity. We demonstrate their performance in a simplified model of cloud convection and show how they can be adapted to work with the COSMO model. The latter is an ongoing cooperation with MeteoSchweiz and Deutscher Wetterdienst.

Modifications of the Atmospheric Moisture Field as a Result of Cold-Pool Dynamics , Linda Schlemmer (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

This study investigates the interplay between atmospheric moisture and deep convective clouds via cold-pool dynamics in a series of cloud-resolving modelling studies. More specifically the contribution of moisture advection, evaporation of rain and surface fluxes to the moisture budget over particular regions of the domain is investigated. To further identify the origin of the advected moisture additional scalars marking moisture originating from the surface and from the evaporation of rain are introduced into the model. It is seen that the major part of the moisture in the regions under question stems from moisture already present before the downdraft hit the sub-cloud layer.

Tuning a Global Climate Model - a Costly Hunt in Parameter Space , Doris Folini (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Martin Wild (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Global climate models have to rely on parameterizations for a number of sub-grid-scale processes. Associated free parameters have to be adjusted such as to obtain a 'physically meaningful climate', a process referred to as 'model tuning'. We report on the tuning of one specific global climate model: MPI-ESM-HAM, the Max Planck Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) coupled to the Hamburg Aerosol Module (HAM). And we carve out some questions related to the fact that model tuning is, in essence, an expensive search in a parameter space, where the parameter space and the score function are not necessarily well defined 'ab initio'.

Modeling blood flow in large arteries is based on fluid-structure coupled problems. Because of the strong added mass effect, the continuity between kinematic and dynamic variables needs to be enforced at every time iteration, ideally using fully-implicit monolithic algorithms. To deal with the computational complexity induced by monolithic schemes, a parallel solution framework is mandatory. We present a parallel block preconditioner that exploits each of the physics involved in the FSI problem. We show the scalability of our solver implemented in LifeV applied to patient-specific femoropopliteal bypasses.

The relation between the sequence of a protein and its structural propensities remains largely unknown. In order to elucidate the side-chain dependent process, we studied peptides of the sequence EGAAXAASS (X = Gly, Ile, Tyr, Trp) through precise comparison of molecular dynamics trajectories and NMR residual dipolar coupling measurements. We show that the formation of internal hydrogen bonds underlying a helical-turn is key to reproduce the experimental values. The computer simulations reveal that the driving force arises from the lack of hydration of the peptide chain on either side of the bulky side-chain, which can act as a nucleation point initiating the folding process.

Immersed boundary simulations have been under development for physiological flows, allowing for elegant handling of fluid-structure interaction modelling with large deformations due to retained domain-specific meshing. We couple a structural system in Lagrangian representation that is formulated in a weak form with a Navier-Stokes system discretized through a finite differences scheme. We build upon a proven highly scalable imcompressible flow solver that we extend to handle FSI. We aim at applying our method to investigating the hemodynamics of Aortic Valves.

Paleoanthropological and genetic evidence point to an African origin and subsequent worldwide dispersal of Homo sapiens, who interbred during this range expansion with other human populations (e.g. Neanderthals). Understanding this phenomenon requires modelling the underlying population dynamics and genetics as well as the influence of geography and climate. Within the PASC project HPC-ABGEM, we developed a high-performance agent-based simulation framework able to tackle such issues. We will present simulations of this large-scale process, reconstruct the genetic history of our agents, as well as discuss some properties of discrete-time stochastic individual-based models.

Image-Based Computation of in Vivo Bone Loading History in Patients , Patrik Christen (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Ralph Müller (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
We have recently developed and implemented a novel image-based computational method to derive a bones loading history from its microstructure as assessed by high-resolution computed tomography. Bone strives for uniform tissue loading, thus the loading history is found by scaling a set of physiologically realistic forces until their summed resulting tissue loading is most homogeneous. Using micro-finite element analysis to calculate tissue loading, this approach provided estimates in agreement with in vivo force measurements in mouse, dog, and human bone. Since clinical image resolution is limited in patients, we here present our new method and its resolution dependency and reproducibility.

Investigation of the Effect of Ca2+ binding on Tissue Transglutaminase , Lukas Braun (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a Ca2+ activated cross-linking enzyme that is involved in apoptosis, wound healing and extracellular-matrix remodeling. To date no crystal structure of the active state is published. Molecular dynamics simulations based on the structure of the inactive form were performed in order to determine the native mode of calcium binding and its impact on the enzymes conformation. The study was based on five putative binding sites (S1 to S5) characterized by Kiraly et al. MD simulations revealed the opening of a potential substrate channel near the active site, as well as a mechanism that may explain the experimentally observed cooperativity between two sites.

We present petascale simulations of microfluidics involving 100,000 of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and a Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) in a complex microscale  geometry. The simulations assess the effectiveness of the channel geometry in isolating a single CTC in a 'haystack' of RBCs. The simulation software harnesses the compute power of K20X-accelerated supercomputers reaching up to 60% of their nominal peak in terms of Instructions-Per-Cycle over 10,000s of compute nodes. With the present software we aim to unravel the key requirements for designing effective microfluidics devices and arm manufacturers and cancer researchers with a ground breaking in-silico prototyping tool.

A semi-implicit method is developed to avoid the complexity of monolithic ones and interface degradation issues of common semi-implicit methods. It adapts the fluid mesh at every nonlinear iteration, instead of once per time-step, keeping the monolithic robustness while reducing complexity. It is implemented in a PETSc-based framework which supports HPC and mixed elements (tet/prism/hex/...). The platform incorporates a novel vasculature segmentation technique with tunable interactivity and adaptive surface generation methods to create realistic models from medical image data, as well as modeling, scripting, analysis, and visualization functionality. The methods are applied to real aneurysm.

The PoSeNoGap project focuses on the design and implementation of efficient genomic data formats and tools for genome analysis applications to scale to large datasets. The proposed solutions shall exploit the available parallelism of the platforms operated by PASC partners. The project promotes investigations on current issues in genomic data representation, compression and transmission within MPEG, an ISO/IEC working group specialized in digital media representation and compression. This activity has led to the definition of reference genomic datasets used to assess the performance of existing bioinformatic tools and to identify requirements for the standard representation of genome data.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are cytosolic lipid kinases phosphorylating the 3 inositol ring of inositol-phospholipids (PtdIns) which act as lipid second messengers regulating key cellular functions. We focused on the isoform of class I PI3Ks and different mutants (G106V, N345K, E545K, H1047R) associated with cancer and increased enzymatic activity. Our work aimed at understanding the dynamical behavior of PI3Ks by Molecular Dynamics (MD). The MD results shed light on the conformational changes and fluctuations upon activation of WT PI3Ks and mutants, complementing the experimental observations by X-ray crystallography and Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry.

Increased intracranial pressure is the most critical symptom of brain cancer, leading to brain deformation, tissue and nerve compression. We present novel approach for modelling tumour progression together with corresponding brain deformations in patient individual anatomies obtained from medical images. We use the diffuse domain approach to implicitly capture complex brain anatomy. The governing equations are then appropriately modified and extended to a larger, regular domain. This approach helps to reduce errors caused by anatomy missegmentation and allows the use of efficient numerical methods that would not be applicable to the original problem formulation.

The goal of our project is to deploy a general framework for multiscale, multi-science applications on a distributed HPC resource. The framework, defined and tested within the European project MAPPER, includes tools and provides a methodology to design, implement and run a multiscale model. We are currently deploying this framework on the Swiss HPC infrastructure, and augmenting it with a performance prediction tool which will allow an optimal placement on the distributed HPC resource. As a test application, we are developing a model for the transport of volcanic ashes that combines models for plume dynamics, advection-diffusion-sedimentation transport and aggregation of fine airborne particles. All these phenomena are produced by different physical processes and take place at different spatial and temporal scales. The corresponding numerical codes have different requirements, some needing HPC resources, but are all tightly coupled.

The computational study of chemical reactions in complex wet environments is critical for applications in many fields. In the present work we propose an algorithm, based on the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method, to handle the Generalized Poisson equation. It allows to solve iteratively the minimization problem with some ten iterations. The algorithm takes advantage of a preconditioning procedure based on the BigDFT Poisson solver for the standard Poisson equation. It exhibits very high accuracy and parallel efficiency for different Boundary conditions. The solver has been integrated to the BigDFT main electronic-structure package and it will be released as a independent program.

A Spherical P-method for Full-potential Electronic Structure Problems , Lukas Drescher (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany)
Co-authors: Reinhold Schneider (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany); Kersten Schmidt (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany)
A major challenge in full-potential electronic structure calculations stems from singularities due to the nuclear Coulomb potential. An hp-adaptive FEM was recently shown to yield exponential convergence at the cost of a large number of degrees of freedom (NDOF) that accumulate at the nuclei. In this work, we propose a spherical discretization near the nuclei that is adapted to the core singularity. By coupling this approach to a FEM on the complementary domain in the mortar element framework, we obtain a pure p-method that reduces the NDOF at the nuclei substantially. The associated efficiency gain versus hp-FEM is shown on a numerical example from molecular Kohn-Sham DFT.

We present a new, efficient implementation of a fully polarizable QM/MM/continuum model based on an induced-dipoles polarizable force field and on the Conductor-like Screening Model as a polarizable continuum in combination with a self-consistent field QM method. A linear scaling with respect to both the computational cost and the memory requirements is achieved thanks to the use of the recently developed ddCOSMO model for the continuum and the Fast Multipole Method for the force field, together with an efficient iterative procedure. Therefore, it becomes possible to include in the classical layer as much as several tens of thousands of atoms with a limited computational effort.

The recent development of the so-called ionic liquid (IL) family has expanded the number of ionic systems that could be used to affect the behaviour of biosystems through the properties of their interfacial water. Our study concerns the microscopic mechanisms underlying these effects, and relies on the combination of neutron scattering and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We present the results for the interaction of imidazolium-based ILs with phospholipid bilayers [JPhysChemB 2014, 118, 12192]. Neutron scattering and MD simulations (i) confirm the tendency of cations to be absorbed into the lipid phase, enhancing the penetration of water that (ii) apparent changes its relaxation time.

DBCSR is a sparse matrix storage, manipulation and multiplication library. It is used in the CP2K quantum chemistry program and its multi-layered structure automatically takes care of and optimizes several computational aspects like parallelism (MPI, OMP, Accelerators), data (cache) locality and on-the-fly filtering. Here we describe the challenges and our solutions for designing the DBCSR library with a special focus on the backend layer and the backends (CPU, CUDA, OpenCL and MIC). The latter, as key components for accessing all available computational resources on a modern multicore hybrid system concurrently, will be explained in more detail.

The Crystallography Open Database (COD), launched as a grass-root initiative by an international group of scientists, has become the largest open-access resource to date for experimentally determined small-molecule crystal structures and is ready to be used as a source for large-scale automated analyses in various fields of computational chemistry, such as drug design and material research. A variety of data access and selection options, cross-links with other resources are made possible thanks to the open-access nature of the COD. Recently, a similar effort - the Theoretical COD - was launched alongside the COD, aimed to collect the results of atomistic simulations in an unified format.

We address the metal-insulator transitions in epitaxial films of early-transition metal oxides through DFT+DMFT. We show that the Mott insulating phase in LaVO3 is robust against epitaxial strain, while LaTiO3 becomes metallic under compressive strains, in agreement with thin-film experiments. The combined effect of strain-induced changes in the crystal field splitting of t2g orbitals and the different t2g occupations of the two materials can account for this behaviour. The origin of the metallicity at the LaVO3/SrTiO3 interface is still unclear and calls for an explicit modelling of reconstruction effects at the thin-film/substrate interface.

Direct Path Integral Estimators for Isotope Fractionation Ratios , Bingqing Cheng (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Michele Ceriotti (EPFL, Switzerland);
We demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate the isotope fractionation ratios directly from path-integral molecular dynamics simulations. The corresponding estimators are derived from the ratio of the partition functions of the isotope substituted systems, which is obtained by a virtual substitution of the isotopes of the tagged atom. Since it avoids the mass integration altogether it is more convenient, computationally advantageous, and immune to errors in the integral for the isotope mass. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of these estimators by applying them to investigate the isotope fractionation ratios in the gas-phase Zundel cation, and in a few simple hydrocarbons.

Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure EXAFS spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the local atomic structure of materials. The interpretation of the EXAFS spectra is a non-trivial task which is addressed in our study using two approaches, combining ab initio EXAFS theory with molecular dynamics simulations or first-principles electronic structure calculations. The atomic scale simulations were performed by the CP2K code for two systems: (i) pure and Cr-doped UO2 which are employed as nuclear fuel and (ii) pure ScF3 which attracted attention due to its negative thermal expansion over a wide range of temperatures. The advantages and limitations of both approaches are discussed.

The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) is a very efficient method to study one-dimensional quantum systems. In higher dimensions, particularly in 2d, this technique requires to operate on matrices with a bond dimension 'm' scaling exponentially in the system width. We present the techniques used in our massively parallel DMRG application which allow the study of challenging systems up to m=30'000. Our test cases is the Hubbard models in weakly coupled chains and ladders. We apply the DMRG to this models to investigate theoretical models for superconductivity in cuprate materials and organic super conductors by studying the pairing correlations.

A local density fitting technique (LRI) is introduced for Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory calculations using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) approach within the CP2K program package. In LRI, the atomic pair densities are approximated by an expansion in one-center fit functions reducing the prefactor for building the KS matrix. Furthermore, the scalability of the grid-based terms with respect to number of CPUs can be simplified and improved. Results are presented for liquid water demonstrating that the SCF step can be sped up by a factor of at least three for large and medium-sized systems. Reaction energies obtained by LRI prove that the approach is also accurate.

Knowledge about local properties is extremely helpful for the analysis of structures and interactions. Calculations provide additional insight allowing, for instance, to quantify the contributions of solute and solvent molecules [1] or adsorbates on solids. We present novel, computationally efficient methods for the calculation of properties for periodic systems such as liquids and solids. These are applied to calculate, among others, vibrational spectra via ab initio molecular dynamics [2,3]. References: [1] S. Luber, J. Phys. Chem. A, 117 2760 (2013). [2] S. Luber, M. Iannuzzi, J.

We study adsorption of Pyrphyrin on ideal and reconstructed Au(111) surfaces and compare favorable adsorption geometries of the molecule by DFT simulations. The most stable adsorption state is the one with adsorption of CN links along Au axis. The interaction to the surface is dominated by van der Waals, but the orientation and deformation of the molecule are determined by the attraction between the CN groups and the closest Au atoms. Adsorption geometries of both monomer and dimer show differences with respect to the modeled Au surface. We will investigate the electronic structure of Pyrphyrin/Au by calculating molecular energy states, N1s XPS Spectra and STM images.

Recognizing Molecular Patterns by Machine Learning: An Agnostic Structural Definition of the Hydrogen Bond , Piero Gasparotto (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Michele Ceriotti (EPFL, Switzerland)
Atomistic simulations are getting increasingly more accurate, and make it possible to model predictively increasingly complex problems. In order to rationalize their behavior, a very promising approach is the use of machine-learning techniques (e.g. pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction) to provide a fully automated framework to understand structural patterns and to accelerate the exploration of the complex conformational landscape in a simulation. Here we demonstrate the use of a Probabilistic Analysis of Molecular Motifs (PAMM) method to provide an agnostic definition of the hydrogen bond, and discuss its application to the description of ab initio water models.

Self-Assembly of Water-Methanol Mixtures at the Surface of Graphite , Daniele Giofrè (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Michele Ceriotti (EPFL, Switzerland)
AFM experiments observed the formation of regular, striped patterns at the interface between a methanol/water solution and a graphite surface. The time scale for the formation of these patterns is beyond direct observation by atomistic simulations. Nevertheless, molecular dynamics shows segregation of methanol at the interface, and a high degree of topological and geometric order in the H-bond network. The regular pattern can then be explained as a regular array of defects originating due to the small mismatch between the periodicity of the substrate and the characteristic length-scale of the H-bond patterns.

We investigated the influence of different methods on electronic energy differences of ligand exchange reactions of a Co(II)-cubane based water oxidation catalyst. We compared average electronic energy differences obtained from sampling with born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics using Kohn-Sham density functional theory to electronic energy differences of geometry optimized structures. In doing so, we also compared different levels of solvation ranging from hundreds of water molecules, first solvation shell, implicit solvent to in vacuo calculations, and finally also investigated barriers and free energies using the nudged elastic band method and metadynamics.

In the past four years, the solar cell field has experienced an unprecedented meteoritic emergence of a new family of solar cell technologies; namely, perovskites solar cells (PSC) using (CH3NH3)PbI3 as absorber. However, two main challenges prevent deploying PSC technology: the presence of the toxic element lead (Pb) and their structural instability. Our efforts to design lead free family of hybrid materials demonstrate that the design of hybrid materials containing organic cations might require careful considerations among them the size of the cell used during the screening process. Our strategy will be presented as well as some resulting promising compounds.

Improvements in computational models of electronic transport are necessary for accurate predictions of photovoltaic behavior. Existing efforts to solve the Boltzmann transport equation employ approximations that result in incorrect trends in the calculated properties. Instead, we propose an ab initio model that explicitly determines elastic and inelastic scattering rates and charge carrier mobility. We have validated the calculated mobility of GaAs and InN, as a function of temperature and carrier concentration, against experimental data. We now show how this model is being used to screen new transparent conducting materials for low-cost photovoltaics.

PdGa has an intrinsically chiral structure and can be grown in either enantiomeric forms. Recent striking experimental observations reveal a subtle difference in the enantioselectivity of the PdGa(111) and the PdGa(-1-1-1) termination with respect to adsorption of 9-ethynylphenanthrene. This poster presents the challenges recently encountered by atomistic modeling (based on density functional theory and on Monte Carlo simulations) in unravelling the origin of the experimental findings.

Liquid Layering Effects on the Kapitza Resistance Between Few-Layer Graphene and Water , Dmitry Alexeev (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

Kapitza resistance (R) between few-layer graphene (FLG) and water is systematically studied using molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast to monoatomic liquid/solid interfaces, R between FLG and water is found to decrease with temperature. The R exhibits a distinct dependence on the thickness of the FLG and the water layer that is attributed to large differences in their phonon mean free path. The density layering of the water near the interface has a significant impact on R with higher water density corresponding to a lower R. Based on these findings we propose two mechanisms to regulate the water layering as means to engineer the thermal transport properties of solid-liquid interfaces.

3-D Radiation Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of the Near Surface Layers of the Sun , Flavio Calvo (University of Geneva, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Oskar Steiner (Kiepenheuer-Institut für Sonnenphysik, Germany); Bernd Freytag (Uppsala University, Sweden)
We carry out numerical radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the near surface layers of the Sun using the facilities at CSCS. The simulations reproduce the well known granular structure of the solar surface with excellent fidelity. Simulations with magnetic fields also reproduce magnetic bright points in the intergranular space as is observed on the Sun. Simulations without magnetic fields show tinier non-magnetic bright points, which have not been observationally detected so far but our simulations predict their existence and basic physical properties of them. The simulated model atmospheres also serve for the computation of synthetic polarimetric intensity maps.

The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method is effectively used in many scientific simulation codes. We present variants of an in place bucketsort algorithm for the PIC method targeting GPUs. In order to optimise performance data locality is required. This relies on efficient sorting algorithms. We discuss the different datastructures that are used where particles are distributed to buckets or stored contiguously. Finally, we show that the performance increases with the amount of storage provided and with the orderliness of the particles. The overall PIC algorithm performs at its best if the sorting is applied.

Green Kubo formulas have never been used in combination to a fully ab initio framework in order to compute the thermal conductivity of liquids. We derive here an expliticit expression for the adiabatic energy current, the key quantity in the Green-Kubo formalism, within density-functional theory and ready to be implemented in ab initio plane-wave based codes. The resulting methodology is demonstrated, as a proof of principle, by comparing ab initio and classical molecular simulations of a model liquid-Argon system, for which accurate inter-atomic potentials are derived by the force-matching method. A first application to liquid water is also presented.

In our talk we will present a reusable approach for poting 200K line Fortran codebase onto GPU: SixTrack model - the LHC Accelerator Beam Dynamics, a part of BOINC Distributed Volunteer Computing project at CERN. The model has been adapted to compile both with host compiler and CUDA Fortran. The problem of insufficient resource of parallelism is solved by performing ensemble simulations. GPU version executes most of the code on device, one block per simulation. Kernel intermixes single-threaded and parallel code portions implemented by postprocessing CUDA code at LLVM IR level. CPU and GPU performances are compared on standard SixDesk test set.

Chaos in Terrestrial Planet Formation , Volker Hoffmann (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Simon Grimm (University of Zurich, Switzerland); Ben Moore (University of Zurich, Switzerland); Joachim Stadel (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
The formation and evolution of planetary systems involves a variety of physical processes acting over a range of timescales. Here, we focus on simulations of terrestrial planet formation. We give an overview of formation models, relevant physics, and how simulations on HPC platforms drive the research. We then describe how these simulations are highly chaotic, such that identical initial conditions can rapidly diverge due to variations in the ordering of compute operations. This has implications for the predictive power of individual runs and suggests that a statistical approach is required.

A central task of the 'DIAPHANE' PASC project is to develop a library of radiation and neutrino transport routines for astrophysical and cosmological simulations. Applications span a wide range: supernovae, the formation of planets, black holes, stars, and galaxies, and many other problems where progress has been limited by the importance of efficient modeling of radiation or neutrino transport. The library includes algorithms for both optically thick and optically thin gas allowing for 'adaptive' radiative transfer modelling. I demonstrate its current functionality and discuss some of the challenges and strategies in making the library portable enough for multiple codes.

Co-authors: Kirill Lykov (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland); Igor V. Pivkin (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Polarizability effects play a major role in many biological processes from effects at lipid bilayers to protein folding. We developed a new method for modeling of polarizability effects in Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). Based on a Drude oscillator model, we first implemented a new coarse-grained water model and applied it to simulations of water-membrane systems. Following that, we developed a model for simulations of proteins, which is based on the polarization of the protein backbone and a simplified representation of the sidechains. We believe that the new models can significantly expand the application range of DPD into the field of computational biophysics.

Astrophysical numerical radiation hydrodynamic simulations often show shock fronts, contact discontinues, or steep gradients across which radiative transfer needs to be computed. In view of applications to the solar atmosphere, we here propose a new method for performing radiative transfer of polarized light through a discontinuous atmosphere using methods of shock capturing hydrodynamics. We use slope-limiter methods for the reconstruction of the source function.

The magnetoelectric monopole - a term appearing in the expansion of the interaction energy of the magnetic field H with the magnetization density - is formally allowed to exist in materials with broken time-reversal and inversion symmetry and is related to the response of diagonal magnetoelectrics. By exploiting similarities to the modern theory of polarization, we develop a theory of bulk monopolization and implement a Wannier function-based calculation in first-principles simulations. We compare the values obtained in the bulk picture to values obtained in a local moment picture and point out the relevance of each description.

Interesting non-Abelian states, e.g., the Moore-Read Pfaffian and the anti-Pfaffian, offer candidate descriptions of the nu= 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state. To study the phase diagram of the nu= 5/2 state we numerically diagonalize a comprehensive effective Hamiltonian describing the fractional quantum Hall effect of electrons under realistic conditions in GaAs semiconductors. We conclude that the ground state is in the universality class of the Moore-Read Pfaffian state, rather than the anti-Pfaffian for small Landau level mixing strength. Our findings have important implications for the identification of non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states.

We propose a new, first order numerical scheme for the approximation of incompressible Euler equations. This scheme has a number of interesting properties, which mimic the behaviour of the governing equations. We also propose a procedure, which allows a consistent approximation of admissible measure valued solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate statistical convergence of quantities of interest.

Genomic prediction problems for plant breeding require scalable and efficient techniques for the solution of sparse linear systems where the matrices involved contain both a large sparse and a dense block. A selective inversion process is suggested that consists of two main steps. First, the selective inverse of the sparse block is computed via the PARDISO solver. Secondly, the Schur-complement of the dense block is computed in parallel and it is used to update the entries of the matrix obtained at the first step. This approach allows the efficient evaluation of selected entries of the inverse, hence its trace that is essential for the solution of the associated maximum likelihood problem.

At present, the horizontal components of the subgrid scale flux divergence of the averaged equation for mass of water constituents are not being calculated in the COSMO-Model. This is due to the discretization, whos stability is limited. We propose a new approach, namely a coupling of the DDFV and finite volume methods, to be implemented in the COSMO-Model. Our results show that the DDFV method is well adapted to the COSMO-Model as it is stable on any grid type, in particular a terrain-following grid including steep slopes. We also analyse computational costs and convergence rates.

Hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and Intel MICs, provide a huge performance potential for HPC applications. However, due to different hardware architectures and development frameworks, taking full advantage of every device and creating manageable code is becoming a challenging task. Dynamic Kernel Scheduler (DKS) provides host application with an interface to schedule communication and task execution on the device and handles all the device and framework specific details necessary to execute these tasks on the accelerator. The concepts and first version of DKS will be presented as well as first results of integrating DKS in different applications (FFT Poisson, MC, Chi-square).

Parallel-in-time methods have been shown to provide a promising approach to additional concurrency for solving time-dependent problems. However, little is known about their performance in metrics beside speedup. In the future, energy-to-solution for example will become one of the key aspects to judge a method's performance on an HPC system. The poster presents results investigating the Parareal method with respect to its energy efficiency using different parallelization paradigms. A simple theoretical model for the expected energy efficiency is compared against measurements to distinguish between overhead from Parareal's intrinsic limit on parallel efficiency and other sources.

We consider multiparametric partial differential equations to which we apply the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. A diffusion equation with distributed, parametric coefficient is considered as model problem. Applications include uncertainty quantification in groundwater flow and shape uncertainty computations. Such problems involve high- or infinite-dimensional integrals, requiring both suitable methods and their massively parallel implementation. We focus here on novel higher-order QMC methods, explaining their efficient construction and their massively parallel application to the problems at hand. Numerical examples consider a parametric space with up to $s=1024$ dimensions.

We present a pre-release version of HPC.m - the MATLAB HPC Compiler. HPC.m transforms simple MATLAB scripts in a few seconds into massively parallel near peak performance applications for CPU-, GPU- and MIC-supercomputers. The MATLAB scripts must employ basic syntax and follow a few simple rules. We have successively deployed this software in the development of supercomputing applications for the Piz Daint at CSCS in Lugano, Switzerland. We have shown real-world applications work, as for example a non-linear poro-visco-elasto-plastic 3D solver. Our code achieves near peak performance and scales linearly up to more than 2000 GPUs allowing for a spatial resolution of over 2000^3 grid points.

We study time and energy to solution of electronic structure simulation in terms of a model that relates application performance to machine parameters. We focus on the generalised eigenvalue problems for dense matrices, and study distributed memory architectures with multi-core CPU and hybrid CPU-GPU nodes. The model explains, under certain conditions, the empirically observed affine relationship between node-hours and the energy to solution consumed by the computation. It allows us to extract an effective dynamic energy and static power (which we relate to effective leakage) for the application running on different architectures.

We present a high-performance implementation for the solution of the space inhomogeneous and time dependent Boltzmann equation. The phase space is discretized using finite elements for the physical domain and a polar spectral discretization based on Laguerre polynomials in velocity. Computations are done in 2+2+1 dimensions with an implicit/explicit split time stepping scheme on unstructured meshes. The polar spectral scheme requires no truncation in velocity and conserves mass, momentum and energy. Dirichlet type boundary conditions are included into a least squares formulation. Results for supersonic gas flows in complicated geometries will be presented.

The scattering of acoustic and electromagnetic waves are important phenomena in many physical models. The boundary element method naturally reduces the wave propagation in exterior domains into a model on the surface of the object. The potential benefits for simulation of large-scale engineering problems can only be achieved with additional fast algorithms. The open-source library BEM++ provides an advanced computing platform for scattering analysis of general 3D structures. We will present ongoing developments and demonstrate its applicability to large-scale scattering phenomena with simulations of high-intensity focused ultrasound modalities for medical treatment of liver cancer.

The exponential random graph model (ERGM) is a statistical model for analyzing social networks. However, estimating ERGM parameters is a computationally intensive procedure that imposes severe limits on the size of networks that can be fitted. Recently, it has been shown that conditional estimation can be used to estimate ERGM parameters by estimating parameters for smaller conditionally independent subsets of the network. Snowball sampling can be used to generate such subsets. A large number of relatively small samples can be estimated in parallel, taking advantage of parallel computing to allow estimation of much larger networks than previously possible.

The goal of a scientist running simulations on top of exascale systems is to take advantage of the latest HPC technologies which are likely to guarantee better performances. Yet, its goals are to solve scientific problems rather than associated software engineering tasks. We introduce ExaShark, a large-scale n-dimensional array toolkit offered as a high-level library for scientists to help computing exascale simulations. It particularly integrates Patus for preprocessing applications that need stencil computations. While ExaShark handles the distributions of the grid using a plethora of back-end communication protocols, Patus computes optimized stencils on inner regions of the grid.

The coupled code can be used to simulate systems from lab to some extend field scale with very complex chemistry (e.g. several non-ideal solution phases in the system). The code runs on various platforms, including massively parallel systems where it uses an overlapping domain decomposition approach in combination with execution of multiple threads for solving chemical equilibria.

Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets have to be solved numerically. Existing algorithms approximate the law of motion of aggregate variables parametrically using a limited number of moments of the cross-sectional distribution. They do not take full advantage of the stationary state distribution. In this paper, a computable expression for the exact law of motion is introduced which leads to the equilibrium's stationary state distribution. The algorithm, a hybrid of projection and perturbation methods, is shown to converge. Furthermore, approximation and convergence issues of some existing algorithms are rationalized.

One of the challenges in economics is to learn about the causality relations based on available data. The presence of unresolved scale quantities may result in non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the data-driven models. They can manifest themselves in a presence of trends, regime-transition behavior and lead to biased results when applying standard stationary causality inference approaches used in Economics (e.g., Granger causality, an approach that was distinguished with a Nobel prize in Economics in 2003). The main aim of this project is implementing an HPC-framework for multiscale causality inference and testing it on a set of the credit rating data of increasing complexity.

Chair: Nicola Marzari (EPFL, Switzerland)
Abstract The need of advanced materials for sustainable energy resources and next generation information technology requires the development of integrated scientific strategies, encompassing theoretical innovations, and computational and laboratory experiments. Substantial progress has been made in the last two decades in understanding and predicting the fundamental properties of materials and molecular systems from first principles, i.e. from numerical solutions of the basic equations of quantum mechanics. However the field of ab initio predictions is in its infancy; some formidable theoretical and computational challenges lie ahead of us, including the collection and use of data generated by simulations. We will describe recent progress and successes obtained in predicting properties of matter by quantum simulations, and discuss algorithmic challenges in connection with the use of evolving high-performance computing architectures. We will also discuss open issues related to the validation of the approximate, first principles theories used in large-scale quantum simulations.

There is growing concern that the energy cost to produce weather forecasts, to quantify their uncertainty, and to handle the associated I/O load from enhanced observing systems as well as large forecast ensembles will be unaffordable with current HPC and data management technologies. NWP centres face enormous challenges due to the rising cost of energy associated with running complex high-resolution models on more and more processors in time for delivering forecasts with substantial societal benefit.

High-Order Schemes for Schemes for Atmospheric Dynamics on Unstructured Meshes ; Antonios Antoniadis (Cranfield University, United Kingdom)
Co-Authors: Panagiotis Tsoutsanis (Cranfield University, United Kingdom)
This paper presents an extension of the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) type schemes for the non-hydrostatic compressible Euler equations in conjunction with two and three-dimensional unstructured meshes. The schemes are suitable for regional and global climate models dynamical cores. Their potential lies in their simplicity; accuracy; robustness; non-oscillatory properties; versatility in handling any type of grid topology; computational and parallel efficiency. The WENO schemes (up to 5th -order) are applied to two- and three-dimensional test cases: a 2D rising thermal bubble; the 2D density current and the 3D Robert smooth bubble.

2D Adaptivity for 2.5D Flow Problems ; Michael Bader (Technische Universität München, Germany)
Co-Authors: Kaveh Rahnema (Technische Universität München, Germany); Oliver Meister (Technische Universität München, Germany)
Many geophysical fluid dynamics problems feature a noticeably smaller extension in the vertical dimension compared to the horizontal dimensions. For such scenarios, we evaluate the potential of 2.5D grids that extend dynamically adaptive triangular meshes by a uniformly refined third dimension. While we tolerate a slight increase in the total number of degrees of freedom, we aim at improved performance due to vectorisation along the vertical dimension. Examples will be presented for simulation of tsunamis and porous media flow.

A Conservative and Grid Adaptive Stabilization Scheme for Spectral Elements Based on a Dynamic SGS Model for LES. Application in Numerical Weather Prediction ; Simone Marras (Naval Postgraduate School, USA)
Co-Authors: Francis X. Giraldo (Naval Postgraduate School, USA)
The solution of the Euler equations by high-order spectral elements is prone to instabilities that must be damped in some way. We approach the problem of stabilization via an adaptive subgrid-scale scheme meant to treat the instabilities by modeling the sub-grid scale features of the flow. The equations are regularized via a dynamically adaptive stress proportional to the residual of the unperturbed equations. Its effect is close to none where the solution is smooth and it increases elsewhere. This is a first step toward LES for hurricanes and extreme weather forecast with the Nonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere, NUMA, the dynamical core of the next-generation Navy model NEPTUNE.
Advances in Numerics and Physical Modeling for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
In view of the ever increasing parallelism of supercomputing platforms and the approaching era of exascale computing, high-resolution modeling is becoming a priority for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) numerical modelers. Today's supercomputers require highly scalable numerical methods; high-resolution permits more resolved physical processes. This mini-symposium aims to bringing together scientists from different disciplines who are contributing to the next-generation GFD model development via the definition of advanced numerical methods and more accurate physical schemes. Interest is given to scalable numerics and high-resolution physics modeling such as, but not limited to, LES.

I will present a highly parallelizable and flexible computational method to solve high-dimensional stochastic dynamic economic models. Solving such models often requires the use of iterative methods, like dynamic programming. The solution method I will present includes the use of a fully adaptive sparse grid algorithm and the use of a mixed MPI-Intel TBB-CUDA/Thrust implementation to improve the interprocess communication strategy on massively parallel architectures. Numerical experiments on 'Piz Daint' (Cray XC30) at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre show that high-dimensional international real business cycle models up to at least 50 countries can be solved efficiently.

The evolution of strategic interaction, competition, and market power have been some of the central issues in the field of industrial organization. However, most of the analysis has been confined to simplified models since solving dynamic models with heterogenous firms, market entry and exit, investment are quite difficult. In this paper we introduce a numerical method for computing equilibria of dynamic multi-firm competition game with endogenous productivity, uncertain demand and entry/exit.

Solving Optimal Taxation Models through Scalable, Reusable Simulation ; Jeremiah Bejarano (University of Chicago, USA)
Co-Authors: Christian Baker (Brigham Young University, USA); Richard W. Evans (Brigham Young University, USA); Kenneth L. Judd (Stanford University, USA); Kerk L. Phillips (Brigham Young University, USA)
Mirrlees (1971) first formulated optimal taxation of a heterogeneous population as the solution to a bi-level optimization problem. This formulation is practical to solve only when people differ in a single dimension. The multidimensional problem lacks an organizing principle to simplify an otherwise enormous number of constraints, and solutions often do not satisfy constraint qualification. We present a method to circumvent these issues by decomposing the problem into two steps: one-time creation of a reusable sample of the impacts of various policies and a quick search that takes an interchangeable distribution function over the heterogeneity and finds the corresponding optimal policy.

Polynomial Problems in Economics ; Karl Schmedders (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
Economic models frequently lead to polynomial systems of equations or polynomial optimization problems. Although the literature on computational algebraic geometry has made great progress in solving polynomial systems of equations and polynomial optimization problems, many difficulties remain. In particular, currently we can only solve rather small problem instances on computers. In this talk, we will review some economic applications of polynomial methods and discuss some current technical limitations.
Emerging Applications of Computation in Economics
Clearly, the world economy is an extremely complex system. Even when modeling only the most relevant features of a small part of this system, one easily ends up with a large and intricate formal structure. A further complication stems from the fact that human beings choose their actions based on expectations about an uncertain future. This feedback from the future makes economic modeling particularly difficult. This symposium provides an overview of recent developments in how state-of-the art computational economical modeling tackles these issues in the fields of macroeconomics, optimal taxation, game theory, climate change, and growth models.

Bayesian Model for Decoding Organizational Principles of the Brain Anatomy ; Lester Melie-Garcia (Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Ferath Kherif (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Switzerland)
A Bayesian Model is proposed as framework to decode the organizational principles of the brain anatomy. This problem aims at investigating how tissue properties ('trait') in the brain manifold predict 'states' represented by clinical variables. Our Bayesian Model deals with the problem of mapping thousands of multivariate variables to a small dimensional space having different sets of data informing the same model. We used the idea of 'Streaming Variational Bayes' approach based on different model evidences to tackle this difficulty. This framework is ideal when Neuroimaging data coming from different Hospitals are not allowed to be used due to confidentiality reasons.

Co-Authors:
Biological modeling is important to study the evolution of genes and organisms. The increased availability of genomic data is pushing for the development of HPC approaches to model evolutionary processes. The availability of Bayesian approaches has been essential to extend the realism of the evolutionary models. The development of these methods based on MCMC techniques is computationally intensive and requires HPC approaches to deal with the computational complexity. I will present recent work to optimize and parallelize MCMC techniques. I will discuss our efforts to extend modeling of adaptation from genomic data to complex phenotypic traits using hierachical Bayesian computations.

Coevolving sites play a critical role the structure and function of a protein. I have recently developed two methods for the detection of such signature. The first method is a combinatorial and compares the homologous sequences whereas the other method is probabilistic and looks for the evolution of amino acids along the specie tree. The latter was implemented in a ML and Bayesian framework. I applied both methods on a large set of proteins. Among these proteins, I took particular care to analyze the Amyloid B protein that is implied in Alzheimer disease. The method revealed that well-known fragments of the protein are co-evolving revealing an evolutionary signature in this protein.

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies and advances in bioengineering, the field of experimental evolution is developing novel approaches that allow for unique opportunities to study adaptation. In particular, genetic mutations can be systematically engineered and tracked in bulk population competitions, allowing for the simultaneous assessment of hundreds of mutational effects. Here, we present a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach that allows for the estimation of fitness effects and experimental power from such large-scale data. Results are presented in the framework of classical evolutionary models, many of which can now be experimentally evaluated.
Bayesian Life Science Models
The development of Bayesian methods in health sciences and biology has increased tremendously over the past decades since they learn about the data by exploring different hypothesis based on a priori knowledge. These models are computationally demanding and may require several million of iterations to reach convergence. Very few algorithms have explored the possibilities of using HPC approaches to speed up Bayesian methods. In this meeting we aim to provide an opportunity to bring together world experts in the fields of Bayesian statistics and HPC, to discuss the potential of new methodologies, and to investigate how to build Bayesian models that meet HPC platform requirements.

Co-Authors: Oswald Knoth (Leibniz Institute of tropospheric research, Germany)
The simulation of atmospheric dynamics relies on the numerical solution of the Euler equations. We consider here sound-advection systems for stratified fluids. These systems exhibit wave type solutions which impose CFL-based restrictions on the time step size. Buoyancy, sound and advection cause separate restrictions each on their own scale. We develop Finite Volume Methods where a splitting approach allows different treatment of fast and slow waves. The methods are optimized with respect to order and maximum stable CFL numbers. Different scenarios for the scales of sound and advection are discussed.

Adaptive Inexact Spectral Deferred Correction Methods for Long-Time Integration ; Sunayana Ghosh (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany)
Co-Authors: Martin Weiser (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany)
Inexact spectral deferred correction (SDC) method for solving non-stiff initial value problems (IVPs) are addressed. In many IVPs the approximate evaluation of the right hand side (rhs) is obtained much faster. This allows us to exploit the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost in evaluation of rhs. Error propagation in the SDC method is studied to obtain expressions of global errors w.r.t. local errors. Work models relating local errors to computational costs are derived. Error and work models are combined to obtain an adaptive tolerance selection by minimizing total work. Inexact SDC is then tested on long-time integration of damage evolution in oscillatory fatigue problems.

I will report on the construction of a temporal integration scheme designed to be used with a higher-order finite-difference spatial approximation to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation with perfectly matched layer boundary conditions for the paraxial wave equation. The temporal method is based on a semi-implicit spectral deferred corrections approach coupled with an alternating direction implicit (ADI) approximation to the (linear) implicit terms. The accuracy and efficiency of the methods, as well as a discussion of space-time parallelization of the method will be presented.

Co-Authors: Marcus Grote (University of Basel, Switzerland); Daniel Peter (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland); Bora Ucar (INRIA, France); Olaf Schenk (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Applications using finite element meshes often require regions of refinement to honor small-scale features. These localized smaller elements create a bottleneck for explicit time-stepping schemes due to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition. Recently developed local time stepping (LTS) algorithms reduce the impact of these small elements by locally adapting the time-step size to the size of the element. The multi-level nature of LTS introduces a strong load imbalance across processors. We examine the use of multi-constraint graph and hypergraph partitioning tools to achieve effective, load-balanced parallelization for CPUs and GPUs implemented in the seismology package SPECFEM3D.
Increasing Computational Efficiency for Temporal Integration
The temporal integration of ordinary or partial differential equations is a fundamental computational problem in many application areas such as molecular dynamics, weather and climate, structural mechanics, combustion, cosmology, and many others. This minisymposium will present innovative strategies for realizing better computational efficiency in cases where the temporal direction creates a computational bottleneck. Topics include exploiting disparate time scales in the governing equations, applying techniques from multigrid in the time direction, and using time parallel algorithms like parareal and PFASST.

Two algorithms to solve the time dependent radiation (magneto)hydrodynamic equations will be described. The first method solves the two radiation momentum equations, which are closed with the variable Eddington tensor based on time-independent radiative transfer equation using short characteristics. The second method solves the time-dependent radiative transfer equation for specific intensities directly based on finite volume method. Both methods are accurate for both optically thick and optically thin regimes and can be used to model both gas pressure and radiation pressure dominated flows. Application of both methods to study black hole accretion disks will also be described.

Many astrophysical studies require an highly accurate treatment of radiation transport to properly determine heating and cooling timescales, observables, or dependent physical properties. At the same time the radiation transport algorithm should be as fast as possible to allow for an efficient usage of computing resources. Hybrid approaches try to combine the accuracy of a high-order radiation transport method with the speedup of sensible approximations. Exemplary, I will present the theory and numerics of our own hybrid radiation transport scheme developed for hydrodynamical studies of star formation and accretion disks. Benchmark tests and science applications will be addressed.

We present a chemistry-coupled radiative transfer scheme for the magnetohydrodynamical simulation code FLASH4. We briefly describe its design philosophy and implementation, and show how non-equilibrium effects captured by the on-the-fly solution of a fast hydrogen chemical network changes the expansion behavior of ionization fronts obtained from simpler approximations. We characterize the differences by modeling a massive star embedded in a molecular clump and furthermore look at the combined expansion of ionization- and photon dominated region (PDR) fronts. We find that the pre-heating by UV-photons changes the stability of the shell typically found around HII regions.
Radiative Transfer in Astrophysics; Methods and Applications to Multi-Scale Simulations
We plan to organize a Mini-Symposium focused on presenting and discussing methods and applications of radiative transfer in multi-scale simulations of astrophysical systems. The subject is timely as it reflects the main theme of the ongoing 'DIAPHANE' PASC project. Radiative transfer is the current bottleneck of multi-scale simulations across a wide range of scales and problems, from planet formation to galaxy formation and cosmological reionization. State-of-the-art methods employed in the major particle-based and grid-based codes worldwide will be presented and their range of application critically discussed. We will foster discussion of innovative algorithmic strategies.

This talk will focus on the efficient solution of porous media flow problems with discontinuous Galerkin methods. For the fast solution of the linear systems arising in the elliptic flow equation a hybrid preconditioner based on subspace correction in the conforming finite element subspace is employed. The transport equation is solved with explicit methods as part of an operator splitting scheme for the coupled system. The performance of the implementation based on the sum factorization approach is assessed on various architectures and computational results for density-driven flow and miscible displacement are presented.

We discuss the FE abstractions provided by MFEM, the use of hypre data structures/kernels for efficient parallel assembly, and demonstrate the benefits with respect to scaling/GPU acceleration in BLAST. We also consider HO adaptive refinement and present recent work on scalable algebraic multigrid for electromagnetic problems in this context.

To reach this goal, the project focusses on a comparatively narrow but very important application domain of stencil codes. The aim is to enable a simple and convenient formulation of problem solutions in this domain. The software technology developed in ExaStencils shall facilitate the highly automatic generation of a large variety of efficient implementations via the judicious use of domain-specific knowledge in each of a sequence of optimization steps such that, at the end, exascale performance results.

Projected from today, exascale computers are characterized by billion way parallelism. Computing on such extreme scale needs methods with perfect scaling and optimal complexity. The solver itself must be of optimal numerical complexity - a requirement becoming more and more severe with increasing problem size - and scale efficiently on extreme scales of parallelism. We will present a multigrid approach scaling efficiently unto the full size of the largest computers available and looks promising for even larger scales. We further show that robustness can be maintained during the scaling process for relevant application problems while still maintaining optimal complexity.

Exascale systems are expected to exhibit much higher degrees of parallelism in terms of number of cores per node. While OpenMP is used today for exploiting parallelism on the level of individual nodes, it is unclear how well OpenMP implementations will scale to much higher numbers of threads. In this work, we apply automated performance modeling to examine the scalability of OpenMP constructs across different compilers and platforms, such as Intel Xeon multi-board, Intel Xeon Phi, and Blue Gene with compilers from GNU, IBM, Intel, and PGI. The resulting models reveal a number of scalability issues in implementations of OpenMP constructs and show unexpected differences between compilers.

The Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) is a well-established scheme in quantum physics to determine eigenvalue density and spectral properties of large sparse matrices. We demonstrate the high performance potential of KPM on heterogeneous CPU-GPU supercomputers. At the node level we perform optimizations which transform our sparse matrix problem towards pure data streaming with high computational intensity. All optimizations are guided by a performance modelling process that indicates how computational bottlenecks change. The optimized KPM code is embedded in a hybrid-parallel framework to perform large scale KPM calculations on Piz Daint (CRAY XC30) achieving 0.5 PF on 4096 nodes.

Computational science has seen a meteoric rise in the scope, breadth, and depth of its efforts. Notwithstanding this prevalence and impact, it is often still performed using the renaissance model of individual artisans gathered in a workshop, under the guidance of an established practitioner. Great benefits could follow from adopting concepts and tools coming from computer science to manage, preserve, and share these computational efforts. I will illustrate here our vision for the four pillars that should sustain such effort (the ADES model: Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing) and discuss their implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform (http://www.aiida.net).

Climate science is highly data intensive and data is the raw material for the scientist for gaining new insights. The German Climate Computing Centre DKRZ stores dozens of Petabyte of modelling output on disks and tapes. Costs for this part of the infrastructure are increasing and we look into methods of how to reduce them. The talk will introduce the most important aspects of data management within climate science and cover various aspects during the lifecycle of data. We will explain how a well-balanced HPC system needs to be configured and which investment and operational costs are generated by it. A look at Exascale systems will conclude the presentation.

In terms of production, capturing, communicating, aggregating, storing and analyzing it this is arguably the biggest and most challenging science data frontier and one that offers solutions for other fields and affords innovation as we move to the next era of the High Luminosity LHC when the needs and requirements can be an order magnitude bigger. I will discuss Big and Smart Data and intelligent data handling systems in high energy physics as we move forward towards the High Luminosity LHC and beyond and highlight the importance of validation and verification that we can afford in this science domain.

The talk will present recent results on the applicability of the time-parallel Parareal algorithm to the in-silico modeling of permeation of chemicals through human skin. For our analysis we use a brick-and-mortar setup as a model problem. A C++ library implementing Parareal is combined with the ug4 simulation framework, which provides the spatial discretization and parallelization. By numerical examples, we investigate Parareal's performance on an anisotropic domain with large jumps in the diffusion coefficients. While speedup from the time parallelization is shown to be possible, load balancing is identified as an important aspect.

We present and discuss an application of the parallel-in-time integration method Parareal to the Einstein gravity equations for a collapsing massless scalar field in spherical symmetry. We show that Parareal captures the correct black hole formation event and generates the proper mass scaling law. Moreover, if the computational load is properly balanced in time, Parareal features speedup when compared to the serial two-step Lax-Wendroff Richtmyer scheme. As we are using a two-level approach in both space and time, we furthermore analyze the influence of the spatial interpolation. Finally, the efficiency of different Parareal implementations is compared with respect to energy consumption.

In this talk we examine an optimal-scaling parallel time integration method, multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT). MGRIT applies multigrid to the time dimension by iteratively solving all time steps simultaneously. This results in a non-intrusive approach that wraps existing time evolution codes. MGRIT allows for various time integrators, adaptive refinement/coarsening in time and space and handles non-linear problems through FAS multigrid. Aspects of the theory, software implementation in the XBraid library (llnl.gov/casc/xbraid), and practical result for a variety of problems will be presented, e.g., explicit/implicit time integration, non-linear diffusion and compressible Navier-Stokes.

Iterative parallel-in-time integration methods like the 'parallel full approximation scheme in space and time' (PFASST) provide parallelism along the temporal axis by integrating multiple time-steps simultaneously. Along the line of a high-order Boris-SDC integrator for charged particles in external magnetic fields we present the evolution of three implementations of PFASST. Starting from a prototyping Python framework, we explain different implementation strategies and conceptual challenges. We then present results using the HPC library libpfasst and describe our new, lightweight PFASST++ code, highlighting the lessons learned from the interplay with existing HPC applications.
Increasing Computational Efficiency for Temporal Integration
The temporal integration of ordinary or partial differential equations is a fundamental computational problem in many application areas such as molecular dynamics, weather and climate, structural mechanics, combustion, cosmology, and many others. This minisymposium will present innovative strategies for realizing better computational efficiency in cases where the temporal direction creates a computational bottleneck. Topics include exploiting disparate time scales in the governing equations, applying techniques from multigrid in the time direction, and using time parallel algorithms like parareal and PFASST.

We present a new scheme for radiative transfer. The goals are a fast approach (low cost, no timestep constraints) for an approximate radiation field to drive chemistry and heating for many potential applications. The method combines ray tracing and the tree method. It is flexible in terms of geometry and can use multiple wave-bands. It has been implemented in the GASOLINE2 code but is modular and could be added to different code types. The result scales well with source numbers and is cheap for sub-regions (i.e. multiple timesteps). We demonstrate test results for ionizing radiation (HII regions) and shadowing tests. We show first results on some astrophysical applications.

TRAPHIC: an Efficient Radiative Transfer Method for SPH Simulations with Many Sources ; Alireza Rahmati (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
I will talk about the radiative transfer (RT) code TRAPHIC (TRAnsport of PHotons In Cones). TRAPHIC is a multi-frequency RT code for use in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. It solves the time-dependent RT equation by tracing photon packets emitted by source particles at the speed of light and in a photon-conserving manner through the simulation box. While the unique design of TRAPHIC makes it ideal for cosmological simulations with large number of sources, it is a general purpose ionizing RT code, and as I will show with several examples, has already been successfully employed in a range of problems.

Co-Authors:
I present an implementation of radiation-hydrodynamics in the RAMSES code, which models the emission and propagation of radiation and its interaction with gas via ionisation, dissociation, heating, dust-scattering, and momentum transfer. We use moment-based radiative transfer, which has the advantage over ray-based implementations of handling an unlimited number of radiation sources without an effect on the computational load. I discuss the basic aspects of the implementation, highlighting advantages and disadvantages, and show examples where it has been used in studies of radiation feedback, the emission properties of the circum-galactic medium, and the escape of UV radiation from galaxies.
Radiative Transfer in Astrophysics; Methods and Applications to Multi-Scale Simulations
We plan to organize a Mini-Symposium focused on presenting and discussing methods and applications of radiative transfer in multi-scale simulations of astrophysical systems. The subject is timely as it reflects the main theme of the ongoing 'DIAPHANE' PASC project. Radiative transfer is the current bottleneck of multi-scale simulations across a wide range of scales and problems, from planet formation to galaxy formation and cosmological reionization. State-of-the-art methods employed in the major particle-based and grid-based codes worldwide will be presented and their range of application critically discussed. We will foster discussion of innovative algorithmic strategies.

The accurate representation of the heterogeneities of the subsurface requires using high order numerical methods based on unstructured meshes. Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (DGM) are becoming very popular in the geophysicist community, but they still have to be improved to tackle realistic 3D configurations. Issues are different regarding the equation regime. In time domain, stability depends on a penalization parameter and efficiency of the code requires task-based programming to take advantage of heterogeneous architecture. In harmonic domain, the size of the global DG linear system is huge and Hybridizable DG methods are a promising framework to reach reasonable dimensions.

Shared Memory Parallelization Strategies for Matrix-free Finite Element Operator Evaluation ; Martin Kronbichler (Technische Universität München, Germany)
Co-Authors: Katharina Kormann (Technische Universität München, Germany)
Matrix-free finite element operator evaluation for quadratic and higher order hexahedral bases has been shown to be faster per degree of freedom than sparse matrix-vector products for linear elements. The key to success is substituting a memory intensive kernel by fast tensorial integration in a way that suits modern hardware. Our shared-memory implementation dynamically schedules integration tasks on non-conflicting cells and faces, offering coloring, partitioning, and more abstract flow graph concepts. Results show that hardware trends with a growing number of cores per memory controller and widening vector units require particular emphasis on memory access patterns into solution vectors.

Co-Authors: Thomas Strub (Axessim, France)
Hyperbolic conservation laws are important mathematical models for describing many phenomena in physics or engineering. The Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods is a popular method for solving conservation laws. We present how we have implemented the DG method in the OpenCL/MPI framework in order to achieve high efficiency on recent GPU or multicore processors. The implementation relies on a splitting of the DG mesh into sub-domains and sub-zones. Different kernels are compiled according to the zones properties. In addition, we rely on the OpenCL asynchronous task graph in order to overlap OpenCL computations, memory transfers and MPI communications.

It allows to separate the mathematical de finition of the finite element basis functions, the efficient implementation of operations, and the calculation of stiff ness matrices and residual vectors. We show how features of the C++11 programming language help to reduce code complexity and thus allow for additional performance optimization such as vectorization.The presented techniques are implemented in the open source finite element package NGSolve. We present examples including matrix-free solvers and high order tent-pitching methods for conservation laws.

In this context, the objective of this minisymposium is to address these needs for different types of PDE models underlying challenging physical problems from modern computational sciences. Related topics are among others, high order or spectral accuracy, space and time adaptivity, finite element methods, finite volume methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, multiscale methods, stencil codes, etc.

We present the performance engineering process for a FETI-DP application (2D nonlinear hyperelasticity) used in the SPPEXA project EXASTEEL. Starting from a pure MPI code we incrementally develop a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallel approach that allows efficient utilization of current multi-core compute nodes. The PETSc+MPI-based finite element assembly is parallelized with OpenMP and as a multithreaded direct solver we have chosen Pardiso. This hybrid parallel approach can extend the scalability range of FETI-DP methods by up to a factor of four. Besides a multi-core scaling analysis each step is accompanied with single-core runtime analysis revealing relevant performance bottlenecks.

DUNE is a software framework for the flexible construction of solvers for PDEs. It has been used successfully on up to O(10^6) cores using MPI. In the EXA-DUNE project we make DUNE suitable for EXA-scale computing. This includes using shared-memory parallelism, wide SIMD units, and accelerator devices while requiring minimal changes in the way users of the framework implement their solvers. In addition, some applications require new numerical methods to overcome restrictions like limited memory and bandwidth. Solving these challenges gives us a set of methods, which we present here. They allow constructing applications that take advantage of EXA-scale computers.

Massively parallel simulation codes will have to be able to handle faults in the coming age of exascale computing. Faults are predicted to occur in the time-span of minutes or even below. We employ the combination technique for the simulation of hot fusion plasmas. It numerically decomposes a single and huge problem into many, but small partial problems that can be computed in parallel. This hierarchical splitting provides a new handle to treat faults without checkpoint-restart at the cost of sligthly slower convergence or slightly higher error. Furthermore, our algorithm-based fault tolerance does not depend on expensive recomputations of missing solutions.

Fluid-Structure-Acoustics Interactions are one example for multiphysics simulations featuring a high model accuracy but also high computational costs which requires the use of massively parallel computers. Whenver we want to ensure flexibility in adding or exchanging physical fields and solver or set up a new model combination in a short timerange, such simulations use a partitioned approch combining independent existing single-physics solvers. We present functionalities, efficient numerics and parallelization strategies that we implemented in our coupling library preCICE comrising the complete functionality required to combine codes to a multiphysics simulation environment.

Communication remains the most significant bottleneck in the performance of distributed optimization algorithms for large-scale machine learning. We propose a communication-efficient framework, COCOA, that uses local computation in a primal-dual setting to dramatically reduce the amount of necessary communication. We provide a strong convergence rate analysis for this class of algorithms, as well as experiments on real-world distributed datasets with implementations in Spark. In our experiments, we find that as compared to state-of-the-art mini-batch versions of SGD and SDCA algorithms, COCOA converges to the same .001-accurate solution quality on average 25× as quickly.

Hierarchical Bayesian modeling provides an inference framework to fuse heterogeneous data into engineering applications. Hierarchical models suffer from extensive computational demands arising from multiple model evaluations and data intensity. We tackle both challenges using our parallel framework for uncertainty quantification. We combine state of the art parallelized sampling schemes to achieve multiple levels of nested parallelism and manage large data volumes generated by the simulations. We demonstrate our approach to the calibration of Pharmacokinetic models using heterogeneous experimental data measurements on supercomputing platforms.

MODESTO: Data-Centric Analytic Optimization of Complex Stencil Programs on Heterogeneous Architectures ; Tobias Gysi (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Tobias Grosser (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Torsten Hoefler (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
An efficient implementation of stencil computations requires code transformations such as loop tiling and loop fusion. In the course of the HP2C project we developed the STELLA stencil library that goes a long way in applying efficient code transformations for different target architectures. Nevertheless, STELLA still requires some manual tuning. In this talk, we introduce MODESTO, a model-driven stencil optimization framework, that for a stencil program suggests program transformations optimized for a given target architecture. Using a compile-time performance model and mathematical optimization we successfully tune example stencils of the COSMO atmospheric model.

A Basic Linear Algebra Compiler ; Daniele Spampinato (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Markus Püschel (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Many applications in media processing, control, graphics, and other domains require efficient small-scale linear algebra computations. However, most existing high performance libraries for linear algebra, such as ATLAS or Intel MKL, are geared towards large problems (matrix sizes in the hundreds and larger). We present LGen: a compiler for small-scale, basic linear algebra computations. The input to LGen is a fixed-size linear algebra expression; the output is a corresponding C function optionally SIMD-vectorized. We show benchmarks against libraries (e.g., Intel MKL) and alternative generators (e.g., C++ template-based Eigen). The typical speedup is about a factor of two to three.

AnyDSL: A Compiler-Framework for Domain-Specific Libraries ; Roland Leißa (Saarland University, Germany)
Co-Authors: Richard Membarth (Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz, Germany)
In this talk, we present AnyDSL, a compiler-framework that allows to define arbitrary domain-specific abstractions in the form of a library. AnyDSL allows to express hierarchies of abstractions and efficient transformation to lower-level abstractions through refinement. At the lowest level, the code can be optimized via exposed compiler functionality such as partial evaluation or target code generation. Further, we will present a DSL for stencil codes that achieves the same performance as hand-optimized implementations on CPUs as well as on GPUs.

ExaStencils: Domain-Specific Stencil Code Generation and Optimization ; Armin Größlinger (Universität Passau, Germany)
Co-Authors:
Project ExaStencils aims to develop a code generator which generates high performance multigrid stencil codes for a certain class of problems. Going from the continuous mathematical high-level description of the problem down to highly optimized low-level code requires to make choices which make the description more concrete and, in the end, yield a fast code. ExaStencils has defined 4 layers of domain-specific languages at different levels of abstractions to express these choices. In this talk, we give an overview of the current state of the language layers, the code generator and the use of domain knowledge in the code transformations and optimizations.
Domain Specific Compilation for Scientific Computing
Languages and compilation strategies that exploit domain specific knowledge are well known as effective tools for the automatic generation of optimized program code. However, the increasingly complex heterogeneous hardware at the core of todays HPC platforms as well as the large base of existing HPC applications makes the use and integration of domain specific compilation techniques challenging. In this symposium, we present and discuss recent approaches that address the challenge of domain specific optimizations in the context of heterogeneous systems, scientific computing problems as well as the integration of domain specific languages with existing code bases.

Recent studies have shown that arising big data analytics problems cannot be performed at economically affordable energy if we rely on the traditional scaling of Von-Neumann microprocessors based on Moore's law. A drastic reduction of energy consumption requires the transition from the current computing-centric model to a more data-centric model in which data is pushed to functional units tailored to the specific workload requirements. In this talk, we present an architecture for such a near-data processing approach and show initial results that unveil the energy-efficiency of custom processing pipelines implemented in reconfigurable hardware.

Custom Data-Flow Engines for Computational Nanophotonics ; Christian Plessl (University of Paderborn, Germany)
Co-Authors:
Finite difference methods are widely used, highly parallel algorithms for solving differential equations. While simple from a computational point of view, these algorithms are hard to implement efficiently because their performance is essentially memory-bound. In this talk we discuss how the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method for solving Maxwell's equations can be translated to custom data-flow engines implemented on FPGAs. We evaluate our work with a case study from the computational nanophotonics domain and show that the resulting solution provides both, performance and energy-efficiency benefits over CPU and GPU implementations.

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can achieve significant acceleration over traditional processor-based solutions. Unfortunately, their inaccessible programming model, which is inherited from circuit design and far from software-like productivity, is probably the main reason for many users to stay away from FPGAs. In this talk, I will present a cost-effective approach to develop domain-specific high-level synthesis tools. In particular, we leverage domain-specific languages (i.e., designed to specify applications within a particular domain, e.g., machine learning) to express the application at a high abstraction level while enabling the automatic generation of efficient hardware.
Accelerating Scientific Computing with FPGAs
Since the performance of CPUs started to stagnate, computing with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has attracted significant interest. FPGAs not only provide massive parallelism and but also allow for fully customizing the processing architecture to the application through a software programming process. As a result, FPGAs can outperform CPUs in speed and energy-efficiency by orders of magnitude for many applications. In this symposium we will bring together leading experts in FPGA computing with computational scientists with a selection of talks that elaborate on the foundations, programming approaches and case studies of the applications of FPGAs for scientific computing.

Design and implementation of solvers that scale to large HPC systems is not only a challenge from a numerical point of view, but also - and even more so - from an implementation and verification point of view. To estimate how a newly developed solver would behave on modern heterogeneous HPC architectures, knowledge of many different programming paradigms and libraries is needed. ExaShark's goal is to reduce the increasing programming burden while still offering good performance.

In this talk we will discuss possible numerical remedies to survive data loss in some numerical linear algebra solvers namely Krylov subspace linear solvers and some widely used eigensolvers. Assuming that a separate mechanism ensures fault detection, we propose numerical algorithms to extract relevant information from available data after a fault. After data extraction, well chosen part of missing data is regenerated through interpolation strategies to constitute meaningful inputs to numerically restart. We will also present some preliminary investigations to address soft error detection again at the application level in the conjugate gradient framework.

We propose an approach that allows current solvers to adapt to future architectures and continue to scale at exascale, and this by removing the bottleneck introduced in the communication process. Our objective is to increase the arithmetic intensity, that is the number of floating-point operations performed per bytes fetched in the memory during the execution of the solvers, indeed reduce the number and the volume of the data exchanged among the processors and the memory. We use the help of efficient stencil compilers such as PLUTO and PATUS to increase the arithmetic intensity of these solvers.

We would like to present a massively parallel implementation of the Hybrid Total Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) method, which is designed to solve extremely large problems using multilevel decomposition combined with communication hiding techniques. In Hybrid FETI a relatively small number of neighboring subdomains is aggregated into clusters and each cluster is processed by a single compute node. This method significantly reduces main bottleneck of the two level FETI caused by solving the coarse problem. As of now the solver is able to solve problems larger than 4.3 billions of unknowns using 720 compute nodes with 64 GB of RAM.
Integrating Resilience and Communication Hiding/Avoiding in a Extreme Scale Preconditioned Krylov Solver
We report the progress of the Exascale Algorithms and Advanced Computational Techniques (Exa2CT) project funded by the European Union. In this project resilience and communication avoiding/hiding techniques are integrated in a preconditioned Krylov solver for exascale applications. We use the pipelining to hide the latencies of the global reductions, stencil compilers to increase the arithmetic intensity and avoid communication at the level of the preconditioner. Resiliency to soft errors is also discussed. We report initial benchmarks of the components and the integrated prototypes on various proto applications ranging from combustion to mechanics.

IP4 Computational Challenges in Macroeconomics , Thomas Sargent (New York University, USA)
Chair: Felix Kübler (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Abstract Modern macroeconomic theory has provided many qualitative insights into the functioning of financial and labor markets in our complex modern economies. But determining the quantitative importance of frequently countervailing forces requires much more than the pencil and paper methods used by economic theorists. My talk will describe some new economic ideas brought by economic theory and how efforts to develop computational tools promise to help macroeconomists perform quantitative analyses that can inform policy choices.

IP5 Towards Exascale Simulation of Turbulent Combustion , Jacqueline Chen (Sandia National Laboratories, USA)
Chair: Gretar Tryggvason (University of Notre Dame, USA)
Abstract Exascale computing will enable combustion simulations in parameter regimes relevant to next-generation combustors burning alternative fuels. The first principles direct numerical simulations (DNS) are needed to provide the underlying science base required to develop vastly more accurate predictive combustion models used ultimately to design fuel efficient, clean burning vehicles, planes, and power plants for electricity generation. However, making the transition to exascale poses a number of algorithmic, software and technological challenges. As Moore's Law and Dennard scaling come to an end exascale computing will be achieved only through massive concurrency. Addressing issues of data movement, power consumption, memory capacity, interconnection bandwidth, programmability, and scaling through combustion co-design are critical to ensure that future combustion simulations can take advantage of emerging computer architectures. Co-design refers to a computer system design process where combustion science requirements influence architecture design and constraints inform the formulation and design of algorithms and software. The current state of petascale DNS of turbulent combustion will be reviewed followed by a discussion of current combustion exascale combustion co-design topics: 1) architectural modeling and simulation of the behavior of combustion applications on future extreme architectures; and 2) programming model and runtime for heterogeneous, hierarchical machines with inherent variability. While bulk synchronous programming and data parallelism have been operative at the petascale, the movement to exascale requires a shift towards asynchronous programming, where to extract maximum parallelism, both data and task parallelism accessing disjoint sets of fields is required. An example from a recent refactorization of a combustion DNS code, S3D, using an asynchronous model, Legion, with dynamic runtime analysis at scale will be presented.
Biography Jacqueline H. Chen is a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at the Combustion Research Facility at Sandia National Laboratories. She has contributed broadly to research in petascale direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent combustion focusing on fundamental turbulence-chemistry interactions. In collaboration with computer scientists and applied mathematicians she is the founding Director of the Center for Exascale Simulation of Combustion in Turbulence (ExaCT). She received several DOE INCITE Awards in the last few years and the Asian American Engineer of the Year Award in 2009.

Adapting weather and climate models to current and emerging hardware architectures is a formidable challenge. We present the design decisions, implementation, performance results and learnings from an effort to re-design an existing, widely used community code (COSMO) to hybrid architectures. Using the concrete example of MeteoSwiss' next-generation operational forecasting system, we illustrate the gains in scientific possibilities, time-to-solution and energy-to-solution.

Is Convection-resolving Resolution Necessary for Climate Simulations? , Nikolina Ban (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Jürg Schmidli (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Christoph Schär (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Convection-resolving models (CRMs) operate at very high resolution (grid spacing between 1 and 3km) where convective processes (i.e., thunderstorms and rain showers) can be explicitly represented. The use of CRMs is feasible in numerical weather prediction since recently, but is computationally challenging in climate applications. Here we present pilot CRM climate simulations at horizontal resolution of 2.2km across a greater Alpine region conducted on a Cray XE6 system using a setup with 2000 cores on a grid of 500x500x60 points. The results demonstrate the importance of high resolution in climate simulations for assessing short-term precipitation events.

Climate simulations using horizontal resolution of O(1km) allow to explicitly resolve deep convection. Precipitation processes are then represented much closer to first principles and allow for an improved representation of the water cycle. We present a set of convection-resolving simulations covering the European-scale using a COSMO-model prototype enabled for GPUs, integrated on a computational mesh of 1536x1536x60 grid points. Results illustrate the interactions between synoptic-scale and meso-scale atmospheric circulations, and the initiation of new convective cells by propagating cold pools. Furthermore we discuss computational benefits from using GPUs for climate simulations.

Reliable atomistic modeling of complex life-science systems has so far been limited by the sizes and time scales accessible by molecular simulations. In this talk, we will present a radical and innovative approach to enable the application of quantum simulations to biological domains typical of classical Hamiltonians. Our approach will merge the extensive knowledge accumulated in the field of semi-empirical quantum simulation and the latest development in low-complexity and scalable algorithms, allowing us to exploit modern supercomputers efficiently and to achieve high scalability and low time to solution. Details of the methodology and efficiency will be discussed.

Organogenesis is a dynamic, self-organizing process. Many of the individual regulatory components, e.g. signalling molecules and their regulatory interactions, have been identified in experiments. However, an integrative mechanistic understanding of the regulatory processes is missing. Computational modelling provides a formalism to formulate and test hypotheses. We present and discuss an according Turing model for the simulation of branching morphogenesis and focus on its numerical challenges. Finally, we show a quantitative comparison between simulated- and real branching morphogenesis in vitro, acquired at the D-BSSE Single Cell Facility.

Large groups of fish in the ocean often swim in recognizable patterns. One line of thought identifies 'schooling' as an evolutionary means to dissuade attacks from predators. There is also speculation that such behavior may bestow a hydrodynamic advantage to swimmers. The mechanism of reduction in the required energy input may arise from interactions between the leaders' wake, and the undulatory motion of the following-swimmers. The goal of this study is to probe this possibility, by numerically re-creating swimming behavior observed in experiments. In preliminary studies, both the leader as well as the follower have been observed to experience an increase in swimming efficiency.

The combination of density functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean field (DMFT) has become a popular method for first principles studies of strongly correlated materials. Yet, one of the most severe drawbacks of the method is the double counting of correlations that have been included in both, DFT and DMFT, and that so far could be removed only by introducing an empirical parameter. Assuming that DFT and DMFT produce the exact density, we devise a method to derive the double counting correction from first principles. We validate it on metals, charge transfer and Mott insulators, and find that in all cases the predicted correction to be in agreement with the accepted values.

The Nanomesh (nm) is the Moire-like structure formed by a single hBN layer grown on Rh. It can be functionalized by sputtering ions, while the pristine form can be recovered by annealing. Argon implantation leads to the formation of vacancy and interstitial defects. The interstitials are atoms trapped beneath the sp2 layer. The vacancies are formed when B and N atom are kicked out by Ar ion impact. DFT-based optimisations and MD to provide better understanding of the observed phenomena. We go beyond the static picture and address the defect formation kinetics, their mobility, leading to aggregation and eventually the self-healing of the sp2 lattice. H.Y. Cun et al. ACS Nano 8 (2014)

Solid state electrolyte transporter for Lithium ions are of great importance in the design of highly efficient batteries. In this study we investigate the static and dynamical properties of a new class of ceramic electrolytes based on the Garnet structure that exhibits the unprecedented combination of high ionic conductivity and chemical stability. Using data from ab-initio metadynamics combined with thermodynamic integration we parametrized a kinetic Monte Carlo model for the characterization of the transport properties at ambient conditions. This model is the starting point for the design of better performing materials using machine learning and data mining techniques.

Many codes and pseudopotentials (PP) are available and attempts to evaluate errors inside simulations have been made. We compare equations of state (EOS) using various libraries of PP inside the DFT code QUANTUM Espresso with all-electron data. A PP is considered good when the squared deviation of the two EOS is small. Using these values, together with the energy cutoffs required to converge phonons, heats of formation, and computational costs, we propose two libraries, called Standard Solid State Pseudopotentials (SSSP), with focus on efficiency and accuracy. We use the SSSP and a screening technique based on stability and bandgap to search for novel light harvesting rare-earth perovskites.

Based on first-principles calculations, we propose a microscopic model that explains the reversible lithiation/delithiation of tin-oxide anodes in Li-ion batteries. At the point when the irreversible regime ends, the anode is ordered and consist of layers of Li-oxide separated by Sn bilayers. During the following reversible lithiation, the Li-oxide undergoes two phase transformations, which give rise to a Li-enrichment of the oxide and the formation of a SnLi composite. The predicted anode volume expansion and voltage profile agree well with experiments, contrary to existing models.

Diamond-like carbon films are considered very promising materials for resistive random access memories. The information is stored by setting different level of electric resistance in amorphous carbon (a-C). An electric pulse is used to switch between the low and the high resistance states. The current challenge is to ensure reversible switch in a-C. We use atomistic simulations at the realistic device sizes to find which structural changes produce the resistance switch and its associated optimal process conditions.

The efficient analysis of large-scale scientific data demands interactive rendering techniques unconstrained by bus bottlenecks or memory limits. This favors CPU-based solutions over accelerators (GPUs). Ray-tracing provides the ideal method, supporting a variety of primitives and naturally incorporating ambient occlusion as a view-point neutral lighting strategy. Our contributions are novel algorithms for coherent and incoherent ray-traversal that significantly outperform previous solutions. We demonstrate the efficiency of our core algorithms implemented in shared and distributed memory rendering systems with the capability of rendering billions of primitives interactively.

A Communication Avoiding Scheme for Sparse Matrix Multiplication , Alfio Lazzaro (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Ole Schuett (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Florian Schiffmann (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Joost VandeVondele (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
DBCSR is a sparse matrix library designed to efficiently perform sparse matrix-matrix multiplication, among other operations. It is MPI and OpenMP parallel, and can exploit accelerators. It is developed as part of CP2K, where it provides core functionality for linear scaling electronic structure theory. The multiplication algorithm is based on Cannon's algorithm, whose scalability is limited by the MPI communication time. We present a novel implementation based on a 2.5D algorithm, which takes in account the sparsity of the problem in order to reduce the MPI communication.

In the late 1990s, mostly economic reasons led to the adoption of commodity processors in high-performance computing. This transformation has been so effective that in 2015 the TOP500 list is still dominated by x86-based supercomputers. In 2015, the largest commodity market is the one of smartphones and tablets, most of which are built with ARM-based SoCs. This leads to the suggestion that once mobile SoCs deliver sufficient performance, mobile SoCs can help reduce the cost of HPC. In view of the experiences within the Mont-Blanc project, this talk will describe possibilities, results and challenges raised when developing HPC platforms from mobile embedded technology.

Co-authors: Trach-Minh Tranh (EPFL, Switzerland); Felix Musil (EPFL, Switzerland); Paolo Ricci (EPFL, Switzerland); Fabio Riva (EPFL, Switzerland); Christoph Wersal EPFL, Switzerland)
We present the new version of the Global Braginskii Solver (GBS) a code addressing tokamak boundary turbulence. GBS employs a 3D cartesian communicator and a parallel multigrid Poisson/Ampere solver, achieving excellent parallel scalability, and it is being ported into manycore and hybrid architectures. Two new capabilities resulted from improved algorithms: the inclusion of electromagnetic fluctuations at realistic plasma size, and a non-Boussinesq Poisson operator for the electrostatic potential. Simulations of the turbulent plasma dynamics are benchmarked against state-of-the-art imaging diagnostics in tomakak experiments, showing remarkable agreement in many observables.

Co-authors: T. M. Tran (EPFL, Switzerland); A. Jocksch (CSCS / ETH Zurich, Switzerland); S. Brunner (EPFL, Switzerland); C. Gheller (CSCS / ETH Zurich, Switzerland); L. Villard (EPFL, Switzerland)
Our focus is to port Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes applied for studying turbulence in magnetic fusion relevant plasmas to various computational platforms equipped with GPUs and MICs. To this end, a so-called 'PIC ENGINE' framework containing the main features of the PIC algorithm has been designed and implemented with different approaches ensuring the locality of the method. Our implementation on the GPU is done using the OpenACC parallel programming standard. The algorithmic performance is tested on the Cray XC30 - Piz Daint - platform. Results show that our optimizations lead to significant performance improvements and will be compared to a reference parallel OpenMP implementation.

In the last years there has been a change of paradigm within the SPH calculations. What was considered as 'standard' in SPH has been renewed by a set of recent formalisms that have helped to overcome various long-lasting inherent problems of this numerical technique. These new additions include, among others, the use of new kernels resistant against pairing instability, and more accurate gradient calculation via an integral approach. In this talk I will focus in how these simple changes can substantially improve our SPH calculations at almost no cost.

High-fidelity Aeroelasticity , Marcello Righi (Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Jan Koch (Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland)
Aeroelasticity considers the joint effects of aerodynamic, elastic and inertial forces. This discipline initially relied on analytical methods to model the underlying physics. Later on, low-fidelity methods such as doublet-lattice became the standard. High-fidelity, CFD-based approaches are of course possible but demanding, as, unlike most engineering disciplines, they require time-accurate simulations, often used to feed convenient Reduced-Order-Models. Availability of HPC might soon allow practitioners to systematically capture flow non-linearities in full. We would like to present the state of art and the current trends.

We present Large-Eddy simulations (LES) of the combustion chamber of a scram jet experiment with finite rate chemistry, using only the fundamental chemical reaction equations. The main focus of this work is to provide necessary guidance to the mesh resolution needed to perform a full-domain numerical simulation of a three-dimensional scram jet, which is M=7 experimental aircraft. The combustion process modeled by the finite rate chemistry is based on the notion that it can be resolved on a larger scale than the levels needed to resolve turbulence.

Simulation of cloud cavitation collapse pertains to the erosion of liquid-fuel injectors, hydropower turbines and ship propellers, or can even be harnessed in treating kidney stones by shock wave lithotripsy. Cavities undergo a collapse at higher pressure regions inside the flow and produce extreme pressure spots, possibly causing erosion. Numerical simulations of cloud cavitation collapse require two phase flow solvers capable of capturing interactions between multiple deforming bubbles. We present the two-phase flow simulations enabling quantitative prediction of cavitation of clouds containing up to 50'000 vapor bubbles on unprecedented resolution of up to 1 trillion grid points.

IP6 Algorithmic Adaptations to Extreme Scale , David Keyes (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia)
Chair: Olaf Schenk (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Abstract Algorithmic adaptations are required to use anticipated exascale hardware near its potential, since the code base has been engineered to squeeze out flops. Instead, algorithms must now squeeze out synchronizations, memory, and transfers, while extra flops on locally cacheable data represent small costs in time and energy. Today's scalable solvers, in particular, exploit frequent global synchronizations. After decades of programming model stability with bulk synchronous processing (BSP), new programming models and new algorithmic capabilities (to take advantage, e.g., of forays in data assimilation, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification) must be co-designed with the hardware. We briefly recap the architectural constraints, highlight some work at KAUST, and outline future directions.
Biography David Keyes is Director of the Extreme Computing Research Center at KAUST. He earned a BSE in aerospace and mechanical sciences from Princeton in 1978 and PhD in applied mathematics from Harvard in 1984. Keyes works at the interface between parallel computing and the numerical analysis of PDEs, with a focus on scalable implicit solvers. Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS), Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Inexact Newton (ASPIN), and Algebraic Fast Multipole (AFM) methods are methods he helped name and popularize. Before joining KAUST as a founding dean in 2009, he led scalable solver software projects in the ASCI and SciDAC programs of the US Department of Energy, ran university collaboration programs at NASA's ICASE and the LLNL's ISCR, and taught at Columbia, Old Dominion, and Yale Universities. He is a Fellow of SIAM and AMS.

Tutorial on Distributed Optimization for Full Waveform Inversion in Julia
This four hours hands-on tutorial provides a brief introduction into FWI and the main cornerstones of inversion codes.
Title
Distributed Optimization for Full Waveform Inversion in Julia
Abstract
Full waveform inversion (FWI) is commonly used in geophysical explorations. The goal of FWI is to estimate a model  (velocity) of the subsurface from measurements of the ground?s responses to seismic vibrations. FWI is known to be a challenging inverse problem that contains many local minima and can be ill-posed.  FWI is computationally demanding;  estimating a model that accurately predicts the measurements requires a large number of simulations each of which is obtained from solving the Helmholtz equation over many sources and frequencies.  We will show how to design an inversion code that can work well for small to medium size problems and can be scaled up to large scale problems. Special emphasis will be put on Julia's potential to distribute the PDE solves amongst all available workers.

<b>Abstract</b><br />
Numerical simulations on supercomputers play an ever more important role in astrophysics. They have become the tool of choice to predict the non-linear outcome of the initial conditions left behind by the Big Bang, providing crucial tests of cosmological theories. However, the problem of galaxy and star formation confronts us with a staggering multi-physics complexity and an enormous dynamic range that severely challenges existing numerical methods. In my talk, I review current strategies to address these problems, focusing on recent developments in the field such as hierarchical time integration schemes, improved particle- and mesh-based hydrodynamical solvers, and novel parallelization schemes.
<br />
<br />
<b>Short Biography</b><br />
Volker Springel became professor for Theoretical Astrophysics at Heidelberg University in 2010, where he now leads a research group at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS). Springel previously was a group leader in computational cosmology at the Max-Planck-Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, after working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics in the United States. He received his PhD in 2000 from the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, after studying physics at the University of Tübingen and the University of California, Berkeley.

<b>Abstract</b><br />
Increasing computational power and advances in algorithms have made it possible to resolve an ever increasing fraction of the scales of atmospheric motion. While it remains inconceivable to resolve all the relevant scales of motion we are currently in the midst of a great leap across a range of scales that have posed some of the greatest challenges to climate science over the past sixty years. This leap is bringing wholly new insights into the structure of the climate system on both ends of the spectrum of atmospheric motions.
<br />
<br />
<b>Biography</b><br />
Bjorn Stevens's research blends modeling, theory and field work to understand the role of clouds and moist convection on the climate system. Stevens has made pioneering contributions to our understanding of how mixing and microphysical processes influence both cloud structure and its susceptibility to changes in the environment. Stevens has contributed more than 130 scholarly articles to the peer reviewed literature and received many honors, including the Clarence Leroy Meisinger Award of the American Meteorological Society for "pioneering advances in understanding and modeling of cloud-topped boundary layer.? He currently co-leads the World Climate Research Programme?s Grand Challenge on Clouds, Circulation and Climate Sensitivity.

We present an adaptive discretization approach for model equations typical of NWP, which combines the semi-Lagrangian technique with a TR-BDF2 semi-implicit time discretization and with a DG spatial discretization with (arbitrarily high) variable and dynamically adaptive element degree. The resulting method has full second order accuracy in time, is unconditionally stable and can effectively adapt at runtime the number of degrees of freedom employed in each element, in order to balance accuracy and computational cost. Numerical results of classical 2D benchmarks for shallow water equations on the sphere and Euler equations on a vertical slice confirm the potential of the proposed formulation.

There are known scaling issues with the otherwise-successful combination of C-grid finite difference methods on a global latitude-longitude grid. Direct extensions of C-grid methods to quasi-uniform grids have known inadequacies. Mixed finite element methods, recently unified under the label of finite element exterior calculus, provide a way of recovering desirable numerical properties but on arbitrary meshes. After some initial work in 2D, we implemented a method for the automated generation of sophisticated 'tensor-product' finite elements. The use of finite element methods also invites the possibility of high-order approaches, though we are not actively exploring this.

Load balancing of large-scale scientific simulations is a challenging task. My talk shows how the open source framework FD4 (Four-Dimensional Distributed Dynamic Data structures) enables scalable dynamic load balancing of detailed cloud physics in the atmospheric model COSMO-SPECS+FD4. The concept is based on separating data structures and decomposition such that the cloud physics model can be partitioned independently of the atmospheric model. To increase scalability, a hierarchical space-filling curve partitioning algorithm is used. Benchmarks on a Blue Gene/Q system show the scalability up to 256k ranks. FD4 can also be applied to other multiphase or multiphysics problems.

The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) has undertaken a full port of the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) climate model currently under development at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) and the German Weather Service (DWD). Central to this port is the co-design with MPI-M and DWD developers to ensure that the code changes are minimal and non-intrusive, do not impose any significant changes in CPU performance, and can be incorporated directly into the development trunk.  In this talk we present some of the techniques which facilitate this co-design project and initial results indicating that the performance is directly related to the peak memory bandwidth.

<strong>Advances in Numerics and Physical Modeling for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics</strong><br />
<br />
In view of the ever increasing parallelism of supercomputing platforms and the approaching era of exascale computing, high-resolution modeling is becoming a priority for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) numerical modelers. Today's supercomputers require highly scalable numerical methods; high-resolution permits more resolved physical processes. This mini-symposium aims to bringing together scientists from different disciplines who are contributing to the next-generation GFD model development via the definition of advanced numerical methods and more accurate physical schemes. Interest is given to scalable numerics and high-resolution physics modeling such as, but not limited to, LES.

I will present a 'big-data'-based MD technique where QM-accurate information is either located in massive databases or generated on the fly if unavailable, and used to predict atomic forces via Bayesian inference [1]. The approach is efficient as it concentrates QM subroutine calls where/when 'chemically novel' configurations are encountered along the system's trajectory. Interestingly, QM-zone partitioning followed by execution by standard O(N3) QM engines is predicted to be a better option than using O(N) QM methods when dealing with large QM zones in machine learning-augmented QM/MM calculations running on HPC platforms.

A crucial step in understanding the behavior of complex materials is the introduction of coarse-grained order parameters that describe meta-stable states and transitions on the free energy surface, with a simpler, more intuitive representation than using the Cartesian coordinates of all the atoms. I will present sketch-map, a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm loosely based on multidimensional scaling, which obtains automatically such a simplified description, mapping with exquisite detail the stability of different conformations. Applications ranging from polypeptides to small clusters will be presented, demonstrating the potential and transferability of the method.

Compared to many low molecular weight materials soft matter is not that perfectly characterized. E.g. polydispersity directly affects material properties. Furthermore chemical variation, for both synthetic and biological soft matter, is huge. Thus there are two options to provide data repositories, i.e. by experiment or simulation and quantum chemistry or by combination of both. I will present some thoughts of how, mainly based on theoretical work, they might be extended to form a basis of generally applicable data repositories.

Physical functionals are usually computed as solutions of variational problems or from solutions of partial differential equations, which may require huge computations for complex systems. Quantum chemistry calculations of molecular energies is such an example. We present a novel approach for the regression of quantum mechanical energies based on the scattering transform of an intermediate electron density representation. The scattering transform is a deep convolutional network, composed of iterated wavelet transforms, that possesses appropriate invariant and stability properties for quantum energy regression. Numerical experiments give state of the art accuracy on planar organic molecules.

<strong>Big Data Analytics for Novel Materials Discovery</strong><br />
<br />
To achieve deeper and novel scientific insight, to decide what new materials should be studied next as most promising novel candidates, and to identify interesting anomalies, the big data generated in computational materials science must be shared and efficient and physically meaningful analytic tools must be developed. The field has evolved in two main directions: constructing large databases of internally consistent materials data and development of advanced, machine-learning based, analysis techniques. Speakers of this symposium will discuss the strong and weak points of the different strategies adopted to perform big-data analytics, towards the discovery of new materials.

Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution seismic imaging method, based on the minimization of the misfit between observed and synthetic data. FWI is now routinely used in seismic exploration, as a velocity-building method. However, the formalism of FWI allows for the simultaneous reconstruction not only of P- and S-wave velocities, but also for parameters such as density, attenuation and anisotropy. This current limitation is due to trade-offs between parameters, making difficult to decipher between them only from seismic data. We propose to review and analyze the issues related to multi-parameter FWI, and propose a preconditioning strategy trying to mitigate these difficulties.

Full-Waveform seismic tomography infers the material properties of the Earth based on the observation of seismograms. Since the costs of solving this inverse problem are roughly proportional to the number of seismic events, source-encoding strategies can reduce the computational effort substantially. We exploit statistical properties of a sample average approximation to gradually incorporate more information into the problem formulation and to update the weights of the encoded sources. This alternates with a Newton-type method based on mini-batch Hessian approximations to update the material model.

Full-waveform inversion (FWI) optimizes subsurface model estimates to derive high-fidelity geological models. A mathematically sound method is described for selecting the part of the geological parameters that is best identifiable from the seismic acquisition geometry. This is combined with either interior-point or sequential quadratic programming methods for performing FWI for the subset of parameters that have been characterized as identifiable. Numerical results are presented on several examples of increased complexity.

The Comprehensive Seismic Earth Model (CSEM) is a 3D multi-scale visco-elastic model of Earth's interior. Designed to combat scaling issues in seismic inversion, the CSEM incorporates models generated from a variety of forward problem solvers, on a variety of spatial scales. Approaching global-scale seismic inversion in this manner allows us to exploit the benefits of both high resolution numerical techniques, such as full waveform inversion via the spectral element method, and more classical inversion techniques, such as traveltime tomography, where each may contribute model updates within their specific regimes of validity.

<strong>Data Assimilation and Predictive Models in the Earth Sciences</strong><br />
<br />
Nearly all fields in the Earth sciences combine numerical models and data measurements to infer unknown parameters or to predict the future state of a dynamical system. With the widespread availability of massively parallel supercomputers researchers can continually increase both the resolution and the physical complexity within their numerical models. By combining observations and model simulations, data assimilation offers a powerful tool to iteratively solve these systems, which may be highly nonlinear with extremely large numbers of unknowns. This minisymposium aims at discussing examples from various Earth science applications, including geodynamics, geomagnetism and seismic imaging.

The challenge of the modeling and simulation of blood flow dynamics in the heart and in the aortic root includes at least the following components:  large deformations of the computational domain, opening and closing of the valves, interaction with the cardiac muscle, and changing flow regime. In this talk we focus mainly on the flow components. We first look at the flow in an idealized left ventricle. The flow is discretized by finite elements and stabilized by the variational multiscale method. The valve is modeled by a zero-dimensional resistance model. We then present a three-dimensional model for the leaflets. We conclude by showing simulations of blood flow in the aortic root.

I will present an integrated model of mitral valve (MV) coupled with the left ventricle (LV) by using an immersed boundary method along with a finite element description of valvular and myocardial mechanics. The model is derived from clinical images and takes into account of the important valvular features, left ventricular contraction, nonlinear soft tissue mechanics, fluid structure interaction, and the MV-LV interaction. The integrated MV and LV model can simulate the cardiac function both in diastole and systole. Further work is required to ensure that the highly complex valvular-ventricular interaction, and the fluid-structure interaction, can be reliably represented.

We will discuss our new developments for simulating mechanical heart valves in left-ventricle geometries. Specifically, we discuss the development of a Newton-Krylov solver with an analytical jacobian, which has improved the performance of our flow solver on curvilinear grids by several folds, with parallel efficiency of 80-90%. Furthermore, we discuss advancements in parallelized implementation of platelet activation models into numerical simulations to quantify the probability of blood clot formation in heart valves. We present the results of our recent fluid-structure interaction simulations, and discuss the flow physics. Finally, we discuss our future plans to advance FSI simulations.

The numerical simulation of aortic valves is a multi-physics problem involving large deformations of soft tissue and transient vortical flow fields. Whereas soft tissue is most appropriately discretized on unstructured meshes in Lagrangian formulation, the three-dimensional flow field is discretized on a structured Cartesian grid to obtain an efficient implementation on modern HPC platforms. The tissue dynamics on the unstructured mesh and the flow on the structured grid are coupled with the immersed boundary method. The parallelization of such a hybrid discretization approach raises interesting questions with respect to data locality and load balancing under a domain decomposition paradigm.

<strong>Fluid-Structure Interaction in the Cardiovascular System</strong><br />
<br />
The mechanical interaction between blood and soft tissue is a central mechanism in the cardiovascular system (e.g. heart valve dynamics, myocardial motion). A detailed understanding of these processes is the basis for the development of diagnostic methods, therapeutic devices and prostheses. To this end, large fluid-structure problems have to be solved accurately and efficiently on high-performance computing platforms with sophisticated numerical methods and with parallelization paradigms, which comply with large structural deformations and a range of inherent time scales. This minisymposium presents the work of leading groups in this field.

From the part list genes, proteins and chemical compounds to the complex dynamics of biological systems, computational approaches are critical. In this presentation I'll describe the challenges linking the genotypes to the phenotypes and the ability/inability to reconstruct what we understand of the biological system. I'll take examples in the field of immunology and more 'simple' model organism to explain the methodologies used to both characterize a system and also to predict novel regulations or unexpected combination of perturbation.

Big data in life science is experiencing the perfect storm: The volume is increasing exponentially with accelerating speed, the variety of data ranges from multi-omics information to lifestyle measures with the help of mobile devices backed by cloud infrastructures. State of the art analytical methods are generally limited by computational approaches. The researcher is forced to limit their investigation to selected data rather than exhaustively mining the data. We have demonstrated that supercomputing methodologies enables discovery beyond traditional methods. Add cognitive computing to supercomputing and the perfect storm can be conquered.

Systems Toxicology is aimed at decoding the toxicological blueprint of active substances that interact with living systems. It integrates classic toxicology with network models and quantitative measurements of molecular and functional changes across multiple levels of biological organization. It combines high content experimental data obtained with computational and mathematical sciences to identify Pathways of Toxicity and the Key Events in Adverse Outcome Pathways. These findings are applied to perform a mechanism-by-mechanism evaluation of the impact of products on these pathways. The presentation will focus on the computational aspects of Systems Toxicology and its applications.

Systems Toxicology combines high content experimental data obtained at the molecular, cellular, organ, organism, and with computational and mathematical sciences aims to identify Pathways of Toxicity. Linking conditions occurring in a respiratory tract with those in the exposure systems requires detailed understanding of flow and deposition of aerosols. The presentation will showcase the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics in simulating flow in a human lung airway model and outlines opportunities for leveraging simulated data to develop well-designed in-vitro respiratory toxicology experiments that have the potential to allow in-vitro to in-vivo exposure extrapolations.

<strong>HPC in Systems Biology</strong><br />
<br />
Systems Biology is a highly multidisciplinary approach to decoding life that combines computational with experimental methods to elucidate biological mechanisms and their dynamic behavior at all levels of biological organization. Systems Biology enables new approaches in pharmacology, toxicology, diagnostics, as well as drug development. The presentations will exemplify how computational Systems Biology can enable the understanding of biological systems both at the genomic and at the structural level, how mechanistic understanding is likely to change product risk assessment and how HPC will turn Big Data into knowledge about biological systems.

Continuum solvation models are nowadays among the most popular tools in computational chemistry to include the effects of the chemical environment in the description of a molecular property or process. The strength of these models is their simplicity of use and cost-effectiveness. Continuum solvation models have been used together with both classical molecular mechanics (MM), quantum mechanics (QM) and hybrid (QM/MM) levels of theory to describe the solute. In this talk, I will present the basics of an efficient, parallel, linear scaling implementation of the conductor-like screening model (COSMO), based on a domain decomposition algorithm adapted to the integral formulation of the problem.

We have developed a novel polarizable force field, called the Gaussian Electrostatic Model (GEM). GEM is designed
to reproduce each term of the QM intermolecular interaction  by fitting  electronic densities using Hermite Gaussians. GEM enables the evaluation of intermolecular interactions for molecular systems with errors below chemical accuracy for each component, and provides a novel procedure to obtain distributed multipoles (GEM--DM). The use of Hermite Gaussian result in the need to evaluate a large number of two center (Coulomb and overlap) integrals. I will discuss the extension of two approximate Ewald methods (PME and FFP) to evaluate these integrals and timings for H2O.

I will present multiscale-in-time strategies to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations. Starting from a metastable stochastic process, the idea is to use the underlying jump process between metastable states in order to accelerate exit events in a statistically consistent way. For example, it is possible to parallelize in time the integration of the dynamics. These ideas have been proposed A.F. Voter in the nineties, and their mathematical foundations have been recently understood thanks to the notion of quasi stationary distribution.

<strong>Mathematical Aspects of Multi-Scale Methods in Computational Chemistry</strong><br />
<br />
In the last decades, multi-scale strategies have been the object of a wide and fruitful development. Such methodologies, including QM/MM methods and QM/Continuum methods, allow to model different chemical parts with different accuracies in the description of a molecular system. For strongly inhomogeneous systems, as it is the case for biological environments, such techniques are extremely important resulting in a large variety of real-world applications at an affordable computational price. The scope of this mini-symposium is to bring chemists and mathematicians working on the methodological development of such methods together and foster this inter-disciplinary research field.

<br />
<br />
Inelastic strain, which is associated to the induced microseismicity observed in CO2 injection sites like Weyburn or In Salah, is likely to occur in CO2 storage sites. Furthermore, CO2 will reach the storage formation at a colder temperature than the rock, which will induce a thermal stress reduction. We model non-isothermal injection of CO2 in a deep saline formation using the fully coupled finite element code CODE_BRIGHT. We find that despite inelastic strain is likely to occur in the cooled region around the injection well, fracture propagation does not extend into the caprock in the normal faulting stress regime simulated in this study.

Due to the increase in renewable energies in the electricity market, hydraulic power plants have to run at off-design operating points. For Francis turbines, this leads to the formation of a vortex rope known to promote cavitation surge. If the flow discharge is higher than the nominal one, an axisymmetric cavitation vortex rope develops in the draft tube cone. Such a vortex rope leads to high pressure fluctuations that interact with the entire power plant and limit the range of operating points. To better understand the physics of the phenomenon and to provide input to 1D models, two-phase 3D CFD calculations are performed and compared with experimental data

Future geothermal power production in Switzerland requires circulating water through deep (~ 5km), fractured rock masses at temperatures exceeding 180°C. The extreme conditions massively limit direct, in situ observation and steering of reservoir processes, making numerical simulation a key research and development technology. The biggest challenges are a combination of complex but poorly know geometries (thin, irregular fracture networks in a large rock mass) and strongly coupled, non-linear processes (thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical interactions). This contribution outlines the goals and challenges of numerical code development in the SCCER-SoE and related initiatives.

In 2006 a magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in Yogyakarta on the island of Java. This relatively shallow earthquake resulted in 20,000 deaths and widespread destruction of the city. About 48 hours later, in the town of Sidoarjo about 250 km from the earthquake epicentre, mud began to spill out onto the surface and Lusi was born. Eruption rates peaked at 180,000 cubic meters of mud per day, and continues today as a vigorous geyser system, with geochemistry studies showing that is a geologic rarity of a newborn tectonic-scale hydrothermal system linked to the nearby volcano complex. We are modelling this system to gain insight of its workings and the possible exploitation of geothermal energy.

In this presentation, recent achievements and progress of the "ppOpen-HPC" project are presented. ppOpen-HPC is an open source infrastructure for development and execution of optimized and reliable simulation code on post-peta-scale (pp) parallel computers based on many-core architectures with automatic tuning (AT), and it consists of various types of libraries, which cover general procedures for scientific computation. An example of automatic tuning by ppOpen-AT on 3D FDM code of seismic simulations (Seism3D) will be presented. Moreover, recent achievements in the development of ppOpen-MATH/MG, which is a geometric multigrid solver in ppOpen-HPC, will be also presented.

Parallel programming with low-level interfaces has been the most viable choice in scientific computing for a long time. In such models, different parallelisms require different parallel programming interfaces, e.g., message passing for parallelism across nodes, threading for intra-node parallelism, and vector processing for SIMD and GPUs. Often applications are confronted with these multiple interfaces to fully exploit the current and future large-scale machines. We present our work toward higher-level programming models, allowing for a single program to run on different parallel platforms without much human intervention, and at the same time to achieve close to hand-tuned performance.

Large-scale eigenvalue problems arise in wide variety of applications such as nano-scale materials simulation, vibration analysis of automobiles, big data analysis, etc, and high performance solvers are required to exploit distributed parallel computing environments. In this talk, we present a contour-integral based parallel eigensolver for interior eigenvalue problems. This method has a good parallel scalability according to a hierarchical structure of the method. We also present some efficient implementations of the method for large-scale simulations. We show performance evaluations on state-of-art supercomputers with some applications.

We have been developing an open source system software, ADVENTURE, which is a general-purpose parallel finite element analysis system and can simulate a large scale analysis model with supercomputer like K-computer. In the system, HDDM (hierarchical domain decomposition method), which is a very effective technique to large-scale analysis, was developed. The aim of this project is to develop a numerical library based on HDDM that is extended to pre and post processing parts, including mesh generation and visualization of large-scale data, for the Post Petascale simulation.

Reliable software is the key technology for future HPC systems. In 2010, 'Development of System Software Technologies for Post-Peta Scale HPC (Post-Peta CREST)' was initiated by the Japan Science & Technology Agency. It aims at developing software exploiting maximum efficiency and reliability on future HPC systems in late 2010s. It includes 14 projects, which cover a wide range of research areas in software for HPC, such as system software, programming languages, compilers, numerical libraries, and application frameworks. This minisymposium offers an overview on recent activities of four projects in Post-Peta CREST related to scientific computing, and discusses future international/interdisciplinary collaborations.

A vertical slice model is developed for the Euler-Boussinesq equations with a constant temperature gradient in the y-direction (the Eady-Boussinesq model). The model is a solution of the full 3D equations with no variation normal to the slice, which is an idealized problem used to study the formation and subsequent evolution of weather fronts. Mixed FEM discretizations on an extruded mesh are performed using Firedrake, a high-level Python framework for the portable solution of PDEs on unstructured meshes. I will discuss the details of the vertical slice model implementations and the preliminary results obtained through test simulations developed to implement the modelling of fronts.

This talk will discuss recent developments in stabilized finite element approximations using nonlinear viscosity methods. The regularization terms are constructed by the residual of the system or entropy equations. The method is successfully applied to compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and variable density flows in two and three space dimensions. Then we discuss about maximum principle preserving continuous finite element schemes for scalar conservation laws. The new method does not require any a priori knowledge of quantities like local wave-speed, proportionality constant, or local mesh-size and it is  independent of the cell type.

With increasing compute power, the simulation of multi-physics gains more and more popularity. At the same time, a flexible software development process including existing single-physics codes becomes a necessity to cope with the overall complexity. preCICE is an open-source library to surface-couple single-physics codes. Its high-level API allows to write adapters for single-physics codes in 30 lines. Afterwards various codes can be coupled in a nearly plug-and-play manner. preCICE offers methods for interpolation, means for parallel communication, and sophisticated fix-point acceleration schemes. In this talk, we present our efforts and tests on the parallel efficiency of preCICE.

In this work we present an implicit scheme for solving the Navier-Stokes equations at Low Mach regimes. The method can cope efficiently with both stiffness and numerical instabilities thanks to the following procedure. A local preconditioner is applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. Next, the preconditioned local system is discretized according to the Variational Multiscale Stabilization (VMS) method. Finally, a monolithic implicit Jacobi (i.e. fixed point) scheme is applied, which, in turn, uses an algebraic diagonal preconditioner on a GMRES iterative solver. The scheme is assessed on large-scale 3D problems, particularly on its accuracy, convergence and parallel efficiency.

<strong>Advances in Numerics and Physical Modeling for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics</strong><br />
<br />
In view of the ever increasing parallelism of supercomputing platforms and the approaching era of exascale computing, high-resolution modeling is becoming a priority for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) numerical modelers. Today's supercomputers require highly scalable numerical methods; high-resolution permits more resolved physical processes. This mini-symposium aims to bringing together scientists from different disciplines who are contributing to the next-generation GFD model development via the definition of advanced numerical methods and more accurate physical schemes. Interest is given to scalable numerics and high-resolution physics modeling such as, but not limited to, LES.

Simulating thermal transport in nanostructures at atomistic level often requires the use of large-scale models, thus making it necessary to recur to empirical potentials. However, systems with complex chemistry, such as materials for phase change memories (PCM) and advanced thermoelectrics (TE), are poorly described by standard potentials. Here we propose an alternative approach to compute phonon properties and the thermal conductivity of nanostructures, which makes use of neural network potentials fitted on a large database of density functional theory calculation. We demonstrate its application on GeTe nanostructures for PCM and on nanostructured Ge-Mn alloys for TE application.

The properties of any material are, on some level, a function of its internal structure making an understanding of structure key to the discovery process.  We use a simple model for particles that attract at long range and repel at short to probe possible structures over a wide range of parameters and stoichiometries.  In exploring their energy landscapes we populate a schemaless, MongoDB, database with over 20M entries, many more than current databases populated from experiment or electronic structure calculations. We discuss some challenges of performing local and global analysis over such a large dataset and detail some interesting finds including never before seen structures.

Essentially every new commercial product depends on new or improved materials. To identify such materials, computational approaches are increasingly employed, with millions of CPU hours spent every day and an enormous amount of data created. The goal of the Novel Materials Discovery (NoMaD) Project is not boosting more high-throughput calculations. The issue of NoMaD is: What to do with the data? In this talk, I will introduce the NoMaD Repository (https://nomad-repository.eu) that was established to host, organize, and share materials data, and I will demonstrate an example how big-data analytics based on statistical-learning approaches can lead to new insight into materials properties.

<strong>Big Data Analytics for Novel Materials Discovery</strong><br />
<br />
To achieve deeper and novel scientific insight, to decide what new materials should be studied next as most promising novel candidates, and to identify interesting anomalies, the big data generated in computational materials science must be shared and efficient and physically meaningful analytic tools must be developed. The field has evolved in two main directions: constructing large databases of internally consistent materials data and development of advanced, machine-learning based, analysis techniques. Speakers of this symposium will discuss the strong and weak points of the different strategies adopted to perform big-data analytics, towards the discovery of new materials.

Present geophysical, geochemical, and geodetic observations together with geological information provide a clue to understanding dynamics of the Earth interior in the past. Assimilation of present observations allows to constrain mantle temperature/composition and flow in the past using dynamical models. Quantitative tools are required to assimilate the data and hence to solve inverse retrospective problems in geodynamics. The basic inversion methods (adjoint and quasi-reversibility) including the methodologies uncertainties and requirements for HPC, and two case studies related to mantle/lithosphere dynamics and to a volcanic lava flow will be presented and discussed.

Data assimilation becomes suitable when the observations are sufficient in number and accurate enough, and if the forward model contains sufficient complexity to necessary for predictions. When it comes to reconstructing convection in the Earth's mantle, data assimilation raises questions for both observations and models. I will review inverse methods used so far, for which seismic tomography is central, and present another angle for data assimilation: using tectonic data as the data to match. I will describe preliminaries and present a sequential data assimilation scheme, and a variational data assimilation scheme, both using tectonic information as the data to match.

Assimilating geomagnetic data in numerical models of Earth's core dynamics is a challenging problem, since the information contained in the geomagnetic record is intrinsically restricted to the large scales of the poloidal geomagnetic field at the core-mantle boundary. After a general introduction on terrestrial magnetism and the observation of Earth's magnetic field, I will report more specifically on recent efforts carried out to investigate the feasibility of resorting to three-dimensional, buoyancy-driven, numerical dynamo models for geomagnetic data assimilation practice. For this symposium, I will discuss in particular the computational cost associated with this exercise.

Ensemble data assimilation techniques are of rapidly growing importance. Ensemble techniques allow to describe and forecast uncertainty of the analysis, but they also improve the assimilation result itself, by allowing estimates of the covariance or, more general, the prior and posterior probability distribution of atmospheric states. 

In our talk, we will first give a survey about recent activities of the German Meteorological Service DWD. Then, we present recent work on the further development of the ensemble data assimilation towards a particle filter for large-scale atmospheric systems, which keeps the advantages of the LETKF, but overcomes some of its limitations.

<strong>Data Assimilation and Predictive Models in the Earth Sciences</strong><br />
<br />
Nearly all fields in the Earth sciences combine numerical models and data measurements to infer unknown parameters or to predict the future state of a dynamical system. With the widespread availability of massively parallel supercomputers researchers can continually increase both the resolution and the physical complexity within their numerical models. By combining observations and model simulations, data assimilation offers a powerful tool to iteratively solve these systems, which may be highly nonlinear with extremely large numbers of unknowns. This minisymposium aims at discussing examples from various Earth science applications, including geodynamics, geomagnetism and seismic imaging.

I will discuss our recent advances in the development of multi-scale approaches for studying complex condensed-phase systems.  For polypeptide and crystal structure prediction, I will discuss heterogeneous multi-scaling techniques we have introduced for the exploration of high-dimensional free energy surfaces.  A two-part strategy will be described wherein landmark features of the surface, i.e., minima and saddles, are first identified and then fed into an enhanced sampling scheme for generating free energy differences.  I will then discuss our attempts to combine adaptive resolution techniques with the Feynman path integral for treating systems in which nuclear quantum effects are important

Hierarchical tensor formats and tensor trains introduced recently in numerical analysis have the same parametrization as tree tensor networks and matrix product states. These representations offer stable and robust approximation of high-order tensors and multi-variate functions by a low order cost. For many high dimensional problems, including many body quantum mechanics, uncertainty quantification etc., this approach has a certain potential to circumvent from the curse of dimensionality. For numerical computations, the groundstate computation can be cast into optimization problems constraint by restricting to set of d tensors of bounded multilinear ranks.

<strong>Mathematical Aspects of Multi-Scale Methods in Computational Chemistry</strong><br />
<br />
In the last decades, multi-scale strategies have been the object of a wide and fruitful development. Such methodologies, including QM/MM methods and QM/Continuum methods, allow to model different chemical parts with different accuracies in the description of a molecular system. For strongly inhomogeneous systems, as it is the case for biological environments, such techniques are extremely important resulting in a large variety of real-world applications at an affordable computational price. The scope of this mini-symposium is to bring chemists and mathematicians working on the methodological development of such methods together and foster this inter-disciplinary research field.

The geothermal community is challenged by the Energy Strategy 2050 goal to uncover the potential of renewable energy resources in Switzerland. To this end we implement a novel finite element based simulation tool for rock and fluid physics. It efficiently couples the dominant processes in the subsurface, such as fracture nucleation and growth using continuum mechanics, anisotropic multiphase fluid flow and heat transfer to provide a deeper understanding. We aim at state of the art performance by using massively parallel tools and modern accelerator techniques. We present first results from 3D fully coupled THM-simulations and evaluate the performance from a series of benchmark simulations.

<br />
We present the results of our recent work, in which we apply the Finite Element Method to study the frictional forces resulting from the elastostatic interactions of surface asperities. To do this, we generate several self-affine rough surfaces that are statistically similar to rock surfaces. Such surfaces are used as rigid obstacles onto which an elastic smooth cube is pushed and sheared to measure the maximal resistance opposed by the asperities. The contact problem gives rise to a huge nonsmooth system of equations. We solve this system with a solver based on our nonsmooth multigrid algorithm of optimal complexity for which we investigate scaling properties.

To enable the large-scale exploitation of deep geothermal energy for electricity generation in Switzerland, solutions must be found for two fundamental and coupled problems: (1) How to create an efficient heat exchanger in the hot underground that can produce energy for decades and (2) at the same time keeping the risk posed by induced earthquakes to acceptable levels' Numerical simulations of different complexity and physical detail are currently being developed for an Advanced Traffic Light System (ATLS) to predict the risk of in induces earthquakes in real-time. This contribution presents developments of the induced seismicity prediction codes towards high performance computing.

<br />
Silt erosion is a destructive phenomenon that may occur in hydropower plants. This work presents a new erosion prediction model in which, fluid flow and solid deformation equations are discretized by Finite Volume Particle Method (FVPM), and  silt contact forces are calculated according to Hertz contact theory.
FVPM is a meshless method which includes many of the desirable features of the mesh-based finite volume method. To obtain a more accurate and robust model, a new FVPM formulation is presented in which particle interaction integrals are evaluated exactly and efficiently. To validate the new silt erosion model, 2D and 3D erosion cases are simulated and compared with experimental data.

<strong>Modeling and Simulation in Geo-Energy and Hydro-Power</strong><br />
<br />
Mathematical modeling and numerical simulation are of fundamental importance for the development of new and innovative technologies in the energy sector. In this minisymposium, we focus on the exchange of methods, concepts and ideas in modeling and simulation of complex application problems from the two areas geo-energy and hydro-power. This includes the efficient numerical solution of coupled nonlinear systems, or problems involving interface effects and highly complex geometries.

Programming models play a crucial role in providing the necessary tools to express locality and minimize data movement, while also abstracting complexity from programmers. Unfortunately, existing compute-centric programming environments provide few abstractions to manage data movement and locality, and rely on a large shared cache to virtualize data movement.  We propose three programming abstractions, tiles, layout and loop traversal that address data locality and increased parallelism on emerging parallel computing systems. The TiDA library implements these abstractions in the data structures through domain decomposition and provides performance portable codes.

<br />
The use of abstractions in achieving performance portability for challenging petascale and beyond calculations is considered in the context of the Uintah framework applied to an engineering design study with one trillion variables that concerns a large 6000 cubic M clean coal-boiler currently under design for power generation. The role of task-based abstractions, runtime systems and portable execution layers such as Kokkos will be explored on heterogenous architectures consisting of CPUs GPUs and Xeon Phis. The success of this approach will be demonstrated through scalability results involving the most challenging part of the calculation involving a thermal radiation calculation that coupled all variables.

Scientists' computing resources are often both scarce and expensive, so high absolute performance is an ongoing key development objective for the GROMACS molecular simulation package. The increasingly wide range and heterogeneity of HPC hardware adds considerably to this challenge, and doubly so when such high portability is also required. It is critical to choose algorithms that match the hardware well. It is also necessary to implement them via abstractions appropriate to the computational task at hand, if we are to do so for reasonable development costs. This talk will discuss recent work in GROMACS that lifts the abstraction level to permit ongoing high performance and high portability.

Regional weather and climate models typically solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) equations using compact stencils on structured grids. STELLA (Stencil Loop Language) is a DSL written in C++ for such stencil computations. It abstracts the underlying programming models and optimization techniques (loop tiling, loop fusion) for multiple hardware architectures. The STELLA language allows to describe stencils with a unique source code in a concise way, close to the mathematical description of the PDEs. We present the STELLA syntax and the performance results achieved for the dynamical core of an important community code (COSMO) for GPU (5.8x speedup) and CPU (1.8x speedup).

<strong>Abstractions Interplay in Domain Frameworks to Tackle Heterogeneity</strong><br />
<br />
Current generation of domain frameworks have componentization and composability implemented in a stable and portable programming model as their primary abstractions. As platforms began to become heterogeneous some domain frameworks added abstractions to tackle the performance-portability trade-offs, for which the current best practices are no longer adequate. However, there is a growing separation between the shortening life-cycles for future programming models and the life-cycle of a community software framework. This minisymposium seeks to collect and document the abstraction-lifting efforts of multiphysics frameworks with a hope of starting the discussion for closing this gap.

Computational science is becoming the third pillar of science. Unfortunately, economics still largely relies on only two pillars - theory and observations. This can change but only after identifying the mathematical and computational methods that match the needs of economic modeling. I will point to the unique features of economics modeling, and illustrate how a combination of computational tools can be used to address a policy issue in the area of climate change.

This paper uses data on single households from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to study the economic gains or losses associated with reverse mortgages. These data are examined within a dynamic structural life-cycle model featuring consumption, housing, and mobility decisions with uncertainty about both life span and mobility. I develop and apply new methods for solution and estimation based on a combination of four state-of-the-art mathematical programming tools. I find that reverse mortgages provide liquidity and a
form of longevity insurance; however, moving becomes a risky proposition.

Dynare is a software tool to solve, simulate and estimate dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. This requires heavy use of numerical methods: such as solving large sparse complementarity problems, function approximation with the perturbation approach or MCMC simulation of the posterior density. 
Dynare rests on a strict separation of the specification of a particular model and the use of standard software tools implied the development of a specificmodeling language. The numerical routines are provided as a Matlab/Octave toolbox.
Dynare is open source so as to make used algorithms transparent. Challenges ahead include occasionally binding constraints and large shocks.

<strong>Emerging Applications of Computation in Economics</strong><br />
<br />
Clearly, the world economy is an extremely complex system. Even when modeling only the most relevant features of a small part of this system, one easily ends up with a large and intricate formal structure. A further complication stems from the fact that human beings choose their actions based on expectations about an uncertain future. This feedback from the future makes economic modeling particularly difficult. This symposium provides an overview of recent developments in how state-of-the art computational economical modeling tackles these issues in the fields of macroeconomics, optimal taxation, game theory, climate change, and growth models.

I present the Julia implementation of GlaDS, a Glacier Drainage System model. It simulates the water flow at the ice-bedrock interface underneath a glacier or ice sheet, both in a channelized and a diffusive macro-porous system. Its most innovative feature is that the strictly 1D channel equations are embedded into the 2D model-domain by simulating them on the edges of the numerical grid. The equations are a non-linear reaction-diffusion equation coupled to two local ODEs. The model uses finite elements combined with a Rosenbrock-W time stepper. I will review some of the code in detail and highlight Julia specific implementation strategies, such as algebraic datatypes and multiple dispatch.

We present scalable algebraic modeling software, StochJuMP, for stochastic optimization as applied to power grid economic dispatch. It enables the user to express the problem in a high-level algebraic format with minimal boiler-plate and allows efficient parallel model instantiation across nodes and efficient data localization. Computational results on up to 2048 cores of the Blues cluster of Argonne National Laboraratory are presented showing that the model construction is both efficient and scalable. StochJuMP is configured with the parallel interior-point solver PIPS-IPM but is sufficiently generic to allow straightforward adaptation to other solvers.

Many problems in earth science involve with the solution of inverse problems on very large domains and with multiple sources and frequency. Solving such problems was considered to be impossible until recently. In this talk we explore algorithmic and software development that enable the solution of these problems. First, we explore the use of adaptive mesh refinement coupled with the use of direct solvers. Second, we discuss the use of stochastic programming techniques and finally we discuss the parallelization of the algorithm using Julia
We use the controlled source EM as a model problem and demonstrate how it can be solved using the above techniques

This talk presents a Julia framework for the solution of large-scale PDE constrained optimization problems. It is based on a discretize-then-optimize approach, uses a (projected) Gauss-Newton method, and provides interfaces state-of-the-art linear solvers (both explicit and iterative). The framework uses Julia's potential for parallel and distributed computation. Being written in a dynamic language, it is easily extendable and yet fast as it will be outlined for a large electromagnetic test problem.

<strong>Large-Scale Scientific Computing with Julia</strong><br />
<br />
Julia is a new and emerging dynamic high-level programming language designed for high performance computing. Julia enables rapid development of expressive and easily extensible code and therefore becomes increasingly popular in science and engineering. It overcomes some limitations often associated with established dynamic languages, most importantly, large computational overhead and imperfect scaling on parallel computers. This mini symposium contains examples that outline Julia's potential for the solution of large-scale real-world problems.

<strong>Advection of Material Interfaces via a Two-Way Particle Level Set Approach</strong>, Henri Samuel (CNRS, France)
<br /><br />
<i>Co-authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
Level set interface tracking is a powerful approach consisting in advecting a smooth function (often taken as the signed distance to the interface) and in reinitializing it permanently to maintain this convenient property. I have recently shown that replacing the standard one-way advection by a two-way wave equation, reduces considerably both the associated errors and complexity. To reduce the erroneous displacements during the reinitialization step, I have now combined this two-way Eulerian advection with Lagrangian particles, as in [Enright et al., JCP, 183, 2002]. Tests reveal a further order-of-magnitude reduction in mass error, making this new hybrid method very competitive.

Hybrid supercomputers offer attractive performance per Watt, yet require care to avoid communication-related bottlenecks. We investigate 'heavy smoothing' with a multigrid preconditioner, using aggressive coarsening with accelerator-enabled smoothing to reduce communication. This maintains scalability and admits a tradeoff between local work and non-local communication. We examine local polynomial smoothing as well as a recently-developed fine-grained ILU decomposition. As part of the GeoPC PASC project, we present portable software contributions within ViennaCL, PETSc, and pTatin3d and results applied to ill-conditioned linear systems from lithospheric dynamics.

We rigorously evaluate the applicability of two Interior Penalty Discontinuous
Galerkin methods, namely the Nonsymmetric and Symmetric Interior
Penalty methods, to variable viscosity Stokes problems. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are less restrictive regarding the construction of inf-sup stable discretizations of velocity and pressure. In addition, the respective inf-sup constants are insensitive to the element aspect ratio. To date, DG methods have not been extensively used for the considered geodynamic applications. Our numerical tests examine the stability, accuracy and robustness of the methods for cases with both smooth and discontinuous coefficients.

Recent advances in regional and global-scale seismic inversions move towards full-waveform inversions which require accurate simulations of seismic wave propagation in complex 3D media, providing access to the full 3D seismic wavefields. We incorporate a code generation tool BOAST into an existing spectral-element code package to use meta-programming of computational kernels and generate optimized source code for both CUDA and OpenCL hardware accelerators. We show here applications of forward and adjoint seismic wave propagation on CUDA/OpenCL GPUs, validating results and comparing performances for different simulations and hardware usages.

Natural porous-media, as crystal-rich magma chambers, can display change in porosities (e.g. layered/stratified environment generated by settling and compaction of solid particles). In this poster, we investigate the fate of a buoyant, low-viscosity and non-wetting fluid injected in a porous medium saturated with a more viscous fluid that opens in a solid-free environment. We argue for this existence of a counter-intuitive process whereby the upward migration of the buoyant fluid is more efficient in low-permeability region (i.e. the porous medium). We investigate this scenario using  pore-scale numerical calculations based on the lattice Boltzmann technique and laboratory experiments.

<br />
Electromagnetic methods of geophysics aim at studying the subsurface electrical conductivity distribution, and typically require  solution of a large number of problems derived from Maxwell's equations. This study investigates the use of adaptive high-order finite elements (FE) to discretize these problems in large-scale parallel settings. We present a new scalable algorithm for solving the resulting systems, based on optimal block-diagonal and auxiliary-space preconditioning. A particular advantage of our solver is that it can handle arbitrarily high-order FE on unstructured and non-conforming locally refined meshes. The meshes are refined by using efficient goal-oriented error estimator.

The 'Comprehensive Earth Model' (CEM) is a solver-independent seismic multi-scale model of the global distribution of density and visco-elastic parameters. Constructed from a locally-refined finite-element mesh, the model attempts to represent the Earth on all seismically accessible scales, with contributions from various inversion techniques. We report on the current state of the model, along with the results of a global scale full-waveform inversion, which makes use of the GPU-accelerated spectral-element code SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.

The Nvidia GPU chip architecture sets new challenges for High Performance Computing (HPC). In order to exploit the large number of Cuda cores optimally, new numerical applications need to be designed. We propose a HPC poromechanical solver that runs on massively parallel multi GPU platforms, such the Cray XC30 Piz Daint, at CSCS. We performed successful preliminary runs on the Cray XC30 Piz Daint at CSCS, and observed linear scaling of our application from 1 to 2048 GPU nodes. The use of supercomputers allowed us to capture the expected nonlinear waves, which results in localized fluid flow through high porosity pathways.

<br />
Multiscale solvers for geophysical flows often utilise implicit solvers, which demand efficient preconditioning. Alternate Direction Implicit preconditioners can improve flexibility and efficiency of the iterative solvers for modern atmospheric research, despite relying on tridiagonal solvers. In this presentation, utility of ADI preconditioning for global, mesoscale and local flows will be discussed and illustrated with computational examples. Implementation and performance of the  preconditioned GCR solver of EULAG model on CPU and GPU will be presented.

COSMO-ART is a regional atmospheric GCM consisting of the COSMO forecast model coupled with the chemical transport model ART (Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases). We present several numerical approaches investigated within the FP7-funded Exa2Green project to optimize the energy footprint and performance of the model system. This effort utilizes evolving COSMO optimizations within the PASC initiative. Furthermore, algorithmic changes demonstrated in the PRACE 2IP WP8 and an accelerated version of the Kinetics PreProcessor are used to improve the integration of chemical kinetics and thus lower energy requirements and computational cost of the gas phase chemistry model.

<strong>Ensemble Kalman Particle Filter for Convective Scale Data Assimilation</strong>, Sylvain Robert (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

<i>Co-authors: Hans Rudolph Künsch (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) </i>
<br />
<br />
The Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) is the state of the art algorithm for data assimilation in weather forecasting. However, because it implicitly assumes the background distribution to be Gaussian, there is potential for improvement on the convective scale, where non-Gaussian features are present. We propose new algorithms which combine the LETKF with the Particle Filter in a way that maintains scalability and sample diversity. We demonstrate their performance in a simplified model of cloud convection and show how they can be adapted to work with the COSMO model. The latter is an ongoing cooperation with MeteoSchweiz and Deutscher Wetterdienst.

<br />
<br />
This study investigates the interplay between atmospheric moisture and deep convective clouds via cold-pool dynamics in a series of cloud-resolving modelling studies. More specifically the contribution of moisture advection, evaporation of rain and surface fluxes to the moisture budget over particular regions of the domain is investigated. To further identify the origin of the advected moisture additional scalars marking moisture originating from the surface and from the evaporation of rain are introduced into the model. It is seen that the major part of the moisture in the regions under question stems from moisture already present before the downdraft hit the sub-cloud layer.

<strong>Tuning a Global Climate Model - a Costly Hunt in Parameter Space</strong>, Doris Folini (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
<br /><br />
<i>Co-authors: Martin Wild (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
Global climate models have to rely on parameterizations for a number of sub-grid-scale processes. Associated free parameters have to be adjusted such as to obtain a 'physically meaningful climate', a process referred to as 'model tuning'. We report on the tuning of one specific global climate model: MPI-ESM-HAM, the Max Planck Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) coupled to the Hamburg Aerosol Module (HAM). And we carve out some questions related to the fact that model tuning is, in essence, an expensive search in a parameter space, where the parameter space and the score function are not necessarily well defined 'ab initio'.

Modeling blood flow in large arteries is based on fluid-structure coupled problems. Because of the strong added mass effect, the continuity between kinematic and dynamic variables needs to be enforced at every time iteration, ideally using fully-implicit monolithic algorithms. To deal with the computational complexity induced by monolithic schemes, a parallel solution framework is mandatory. We present a parallel block preconditioner that exploits each of the physics involved in the FSI problem. We show the scalability of our solver implemented in LifeV applied to patient-specific femoropopliteal bypasses.

Agent-based models (ABMs) are bottom-up computational models of ecological systems and populations built from individuals. In the context of the PASC project HPC-ABGEM, we develop an ABM of human population dynamics in space and time, including life history traits of modern hunter-gatherers such as individual survival probability as a function of age and sex, daily energy requirements, fertility rates, etc. We present preliminarily simulation results and compare the emerging large-scale characteristics of the simulated population with observational data and classical (continuum) models.

The relation between the sequence of a protein and its structural propensities remains largely unknown. In order to elucidate the side-chain dependent process, we studied peptides of the sequence EGAAXAASS (X = Gly, Ile, Tyr, Trp) through precise comparison of molecular dynamics trajectories and NMR residual dipolar coupling measurements. We show that the formation of internal hydrogen bonds underlying a helical-turn is key to reproduce the experimental values. The computer simulations reveal that the driving force arises from the lack of hydration of the peptide chain on either side of the bulky side-chain, which can act as a nucleation point initiating the folding process.

Immersed boundary simulations have been under development for physiological flows, allowing for elegant handling of fluid-structure interaction modelling with large deformations due to retained domain-specific meshing. We couple a structural system in Lagrangian representation that is formulated in a weak form with a Navier-Stokes system discretized through a finite differences scheme. We build upon a proven highly scalable imcompressible flow solver that we extend to handle FSI. We aim at applying our method to investigating the hemodynamics of Aortic Valves. The code is going to be extended to conform to the new hybrid-node supercomputers.

Paleoanthropological and genetic evidence point to an African origin and subsequent worldwide dispersal of Homo sapiens, who interbred during this range expansion with other human populations (e.g. Neanderthals). Understanding this phenomenon requires modelling the underlying population dynamics and genetics as well as the influence of geography and climate. Within the PASC project HPC-ABGEM, we developed a high-performance agent-based simulation framework able to tackle such issues. We will present simulations of this large-scale process, reconstruct the genetic history of our agents, as well as discuss some properties of discrete-time stochastic individual-based models.

<strong>Image-Based Computation of in Vivo Bone Loading History in Patients</strong>, Patrik Christen (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
<br /><br />
<i>Co-authors: Ralph Müller (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
We have recently developed and implemented a novel image-based computational method to derive a bones loading history from its microstructure as assessed by high-resolution computed tomography. Bone strives for uniform tissue loading, thus the loading history is found by scaling a set of physiologically realistic forces until their summed resulting tissue loading is most homogeneous. Using micro-finite element analysis to calculate tissue loading, this approach provided estimates in agreement with in vivo force measurements in mouse, dog, and human bone. Since clinical image resolution is limited in patients, we here present our new method and its resolution dependency and reproducibility.

<br />
Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a Ca2+ activated cross-linking enzyme that is involved in apoptosis, wound healing and extracellular-matrix remodeling. To date no crystal structure of the active state is published. Molecular dynamics simulations based on the structure of the inactive form were performed in order to determine the native mode of calcium binding and its impact on the enzymes conformation. The study was based on five putative binding sites (S1 to S5) characterized by Kiraly et al. MD simulations revealed the opening of a potential substrate channel near the active site, as well as a mechanism that may explain the experimentally observed cooperativity between two sites.

We present petascale simulations of microfluidics involving 100,000 of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and a Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) in a complex microscale  geometry. The simulations assess the effectiveness of the channel geometry in isolating a single CTC in a 'haystack' of RBCs. The simulation software harnesses the compute power of K20X-accelerated supercomputers reaching up to 60% of their nominal peak in terms of Instructions-Per-Cycle over 10,000s of compute nodes. With the present software we aim to unravel the key requirements for designing effective microfluidics devices and arm manufacturers and cancer researchers with a ground breaking in-silico prototyping tool.

A semi-implicit method is developed to avoid the complexity of monolithic ones and interface degradation issues of common semi-implicit methods. It adapts the fluid mesh at every nonlinear iteration, instead of once per time-step, keeping the monolithic robustness while reducing complexity. It is implemented in a PETSc-based framework which supports HPC and mixed elements (tet/prism/hex/...). The platform incorporates a novel vasculature segmentation technique with tunable interactivity and adaptive surface generation methods to create realistic models from medical image data, as well as modeling, scripting, analysis, and visualization functionality. The methods are applied to real aneurysm.

The PoSeNoGap project focuses on the design and implementation of efficient genomic data formats and tools for genome analysis applications to scale to large datasets. The proposed solutions shall exploit the available parallelism of the platforms operated by PASC partners. The project promotes investigations on current issues in genomic data representation, compression and transmission within MPEG, an ISO/IEC working group specialized in digital media representation and compression. This activity has led to the definition of reference genomic datasets used to assess the performance of existing bioinformatic tools and to identify requirements for the standard representation of genome data.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are cytosolic lipid kinases phosphorylating the 3 inositol ring of inositol-phospholipids (PtdIns) which act as lipid second messengers regulating key cellular functions. We focused on the isoform of class I PI3Ks and different mutants (G106V, N345K, E545K, H1047R) associated with cancer and increased enzymatic activity.
Our work aimed at understanding the dynamical behavior of PI3Ks by Molecular Dynamics (MD). The MD results shed light on the conformational changes and fluctuations upon activation of WT PI3Ks and mutants, complementing the experimental observations by X-ray crystallography and Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry.

Increased intracranial pressure is the most critical symptom of brain cancer, leading to brain deformation, tissue and nerve compression. We present novel approach for modelling tumour progression together with corresponding brain deformations in patient individual anatomies obtained from medical images. We use the diffuse domain approach to implicitly capture complex brain anatomy. The governing equations are then appropriately modified and extended to a larger, regular domain. This approach helps to reduce errors caused by anatomy missegmentation and allows the use of efficient numerical methods that  would not be applicable to the original problem formulation.

The goal of our project is to deploy a general framework for
multiscale, multi-science applications on a distributed HPC resource.
The framework, defined and tested within the European project MAPPER,
includes tools and provides a methodology to design, implement and run
a multiscale model. We are currently deploying this framework on the
Swiss HPC infrastructure, and augmenting it with a performance
prediction tool which will allow an optimal placement on the
distributed HPC resource.  As a test application, we are developing
a model for the transport of volcanic ashes that combines models for
plume dynamics, advection-diffusion-sedimentation transport and
aggregation of fine airborne particles. All these phenomena are
produced by different physical processes and take place at different
spatial and temporal scales. The corresponding numerical codes have
different requirements, some needing HPC resources, but are all
tightly coupled.

First-principles materials science codes based on density functional theory (DFT) and using plane waves (PW) have become the largest user (by method) of computer cycles at scientific computer centers around the world. We present a hybrid OpenMP/MPI Conjugate Gradient based iterative eigensolver that allows this approach to scale to tens of thousands of cores on modern many core parallel computers. Performance results will be presented for the Cray XE6 and XC30 architectures.

The computational study of chemical reactions in complex wet environments is critical for applications in many fields. In the present work we propose an algorithm, based on the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method, to handle the Generalized Poisson equation. It allows to solve iteratively the minimization problem with some ten iterations. The algorithm takes advantage of a preconditioning procedure based on the BigDFT Poisson solver for the standard Poisson equation. It exhibits very high accuracy and parallel efficiency for different Boundary conditions. The solver has been integrated to the BigDFT main electronic-structure package and it will be released as a independent program.

<br />
<br />
A major challenge in full-potential electronic structure calculations stems from singularities due to the nuclear Coulomb potential. An hp-adaptive FEM was recently shown to yield exponential convergence at the cost of a large number of degrees of freedom (NDOF) that accumulate at the nuclei. In this work, we propose a spherical discretization near the nuclei that is adapted to the core singularity. By coupling this approach to a FEM on the complementary domain in the mortar element framework, we obtain a pure p-method that reduces the NDOF at the nuclei substantially. The associated efficiency gain versus hp-FEM is shown on a numerical example from molecular Kohn-Sham DFT.

The ANSWERS project (Accelerating nano-device simulations with extreme-scale algorithms and software co-integration) is currently supported by the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC). Its main objectives consist in developing numerical algorithms and software on hybrid manycore architectures specifically dedicated to ab-initio electronic structure and quantum transport calculations of realistic nanostructures. This poster intends to summarize the progresses of the project and highlight the future research directions.

We present a new, efficient implementation of a fully polarizable QM/MM/continuum model based on an induced-dipoles polarizable force field and on the Conductor-like Screening Model as a polarizable continuum in combination with a self-consistent field QM method. A linear scaling with respect to both the computational cost and the memory requirements is achieved thanks to the use of the recently developed ddCOSMO model for the continuum and the Fast Multipole Method for the force field, together with an efficient iterative procedure. Therefore, it becomes possible to include in the classical layer as much as several tens of thousands of atoms with a limited computational effort.

The recent development of the so-called ionic liquid (IL) family has expanded the number of ionic systems that could be used to affect the behaviour of biosystems through the properties of their interfacial water. Our study concerns the microscopic mechanisms underlying these effects, and relies on the combination of neutron scattering and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We present the results for the interaction of imidazolium-based ILs with phospholipid bilayers [JPhysChemB 2014, 118, 12192]. Neutron scattering and MD simulations (i) confirm the tendency of cations to be absorbed into the lipid phase, enhancing the penetration of water that (ii) apparent changes its relaxation time.

DBCSR is a sparse matrix storage, manipulation and multiplication library. It is used in the CP2K quantum chemistry program and its multi-layered structure automatically takes care of and optimizes several computational aspects like parallelism (MPI, OMP, Accelerators), data (cache) locality and on-the-fly filtering. Here we describe the challenges and our solutions for designing the DBCSR library with a special focus on the backend layer and the backends (CPU, CUDA, OpenCL and MIC). The latter, as key components for accessing all available computational resources on a modern multicore hybrid system concurrently, will be explained in more detail.

The Crystallography Open Database (COD), launched as a grass-root initiative by an international group of scientists, has become the largest open-access resource to date for experimentally determined small-molecule crystal structures and is ready to be used as a source for large-scale automated analyses in various fields of computational chemistry, such as drug design and material research. A variety of data access and selection options, cross-links with other resources are made possible thanks to the open-access nature of the COD. Recently, a similar effort - the Theoretical COD - was launched alongside the COD, aimed to collect the results of atomistic simulations in an unified format.

<br />
We address the metal-insulator transitions in epitaxial  films of early-transition metal oxides through DFT+DMFT. We show that the Mott insulating phase in LaVO3 is robust against epitaxial strain, while LaTiO3 becomes metallic under compressive strains, in agreement with thin-film experiments. The combined effect of strain-induced changes in the crystal field splitting of t2g orbitals and the different t2g occupations of the two materials can account for this behaviour. The origin of the metallicity at the LaVO3/SrTiO3 interface is still unclear and calls for an explicit modelling of reconstruction effects at the thin-film/substrate interface.

We demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate the isotope fractionation ratios directly from path-integral molecular dynamics simulations. The corresponding estimators are derived from the ratio of the partition functions of the isotope substituted systems, which is obtained by a virtual substitution of the isotopes of
the tagged atom. Since it avoids the mass integration altogether it is more convenient, computationally advantageous, and immune to errors in the integral for the isotope mass. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of these estimators by applying them to investigate the isotope fractionation ratios in the gas-phase Zundel cation, and in a few simple hydrocarbons.

Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure EXAFS spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the local atomic structure of materials. The interpretation of the EXAFS spectra is a non-trivial task which is addressed in our study using two approaches, combining ab initio EXAFS theory with molecular dynamics simulations or first-principles electronic structure calculations. The atomic scale simulations were performed by the CP2K code for two systems: (i) pure and Cr-doped UO2 which are employed as nuclear fuel and (ii) pure ScF3 which attracted attention due to its negative thermal expansion over a wide range of temperatures. The advantages and limitations of both approaches are discussed.

The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) is a very efficient method to study one-dimensional quantum systems. In higher dimensions, particularly in 2d, this technique requires to operate on matrices with a bond dimension 'm' scaling exponentially in the system width. We present the techniques used in our massively parallel DMRG application which allow the study of challenging systems up to m=30'000. Our test cases is the Hubbard models in weakly coupled chains and ladders. We apply the DMRG to this models to investigate theoretical models for superconductivity in cuprate materials and organic super conductors by studying the pairing correlations.

<br />
A local density fitting technique (LRI) is introduced for Kohn-Sham (KS) density  functional theory calculations using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) approach within the CP2K program package. In LRI, the atomic pair densities are approximated by an expansion in one-center fit functions reducing the prefactor for building the KS matrix. Furthermore, the scalability of the grid-based terms with respect to number of CPUs can be simplified and improved. Results are presented for liquid water demonstrating that the SCF step can be sped up by a factor of at least three for large and medium-sized systems. Reaction energies obtained by LRI prove that the approach is also accurate.

Knowledge about local properties is extremely helpful for the analysis of structures and interactions. Calculations provide additional insight allowing, for instance, to quantify the contributions of solute and solvent molecules [1] or adsorbates on solids. We present novel, computationally efficient methods for the calculation of properties for periodic systems such as liquids and solids. These are applied to calculate, among others, vibrational spectra via ab initio molecular dynamics [2,3].

We study adsorption of Pyrphyrin on ideal and reconstructed Au(111) surfaces and compare favorable adsorption geometries of the molecule by DFT simulations. The most stable adsorption state is the one with adsorption of CN links along Au axis. The interaction to the surface is dominated by van der Waals, but the orientation and deformation of the molecule are determined by the attraction between the CN groups and the closest Au atoms. Adsorption geometries of both monomer and dimer show differences with respect to the modeled Au surface. We will investigate the electronic structure of Pyrphyrin/Au by calculating molecular energy states, N1s XPS Spectra and STM images.

Atomistic simulations are getting increasingly more accurate, and make it possible to model predictively increasingly complex problems. In order to rationalize their behavior, a very promising approach is the use of machine-learning techniques (e.g. pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction) to provide a fully automated framework to understand structural patterns and to accelerate the exploration of the complex conformational landscape in a simulation. Here we demonstrate the use of a Probabilistic Analysis of Molecular Motifs (PAMM) method to provide an agnostic definition of the hydrogen bond, and discuss its application to the description of ab initio water models.

AFM experiments observed the formation of regular, striped patterns at the interface between a methanol/water solution and a graphite surface. The time scale for the formation of these patterns is beyond direct observation by atomistic simulations. Nevertheless, molecular dynamics shows segregation of methanol at the interface, and a high degree of topological and geometric order in the H-bond network. The regular pattern can then be explained as a regular array of defects originating due to the small mismatch between the periodicity of the substrate and the characteristic length-scale of the H-bond patterns.

We investigated the influence of different methods on electronic energy differences of ligand exchange reactions of a Co(II)-cubane based water oxidation catalyst. We compared average electronic energy differences obtained from sampling with born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics using Kohn-Sham density functional theory to electronic energy differences of geometry optimized structures. In doing so, we also compared different levels of solvation ranging from hundreds of water molecules, first solvation shell, implicit solvent to in vacuo calculations, and finally also investigated barriers and free energies using the nudged elastic band method and metadynamics.

In the past four years, the solar cell field has experienced an unprecedented meteoritic emergence of a new family of solar cell technologies; namely, perovskites solar cells (PSC) using (CH3NH3)PbI3 as absorber. However, two main challenges prevent deploying PSC technology:  the presence of the toxic element lead (Pb) and their structural instability. Our efforts to design lead free family of hybrid materials demonstrate that the design of hybrid materials containing organic cations might require careful considerations among them the size of the cell used during the screening process. Our strategy will be presented as well as some resulting promising compounds.

Improvements in computational models of electronic transport are necessary for accurate predictions of photovoltaic behavior. Existing efforts to solve the Boltzmann transport equation employ approximations that result in incorrect trends in the calculated properties. Instead, we propose an ab initio model that explicitly determines elastic and inelastic scattering rates and charge carrier mobility.  We have validated the calculated mobility of GaAs and InN, as a function of temperature and carrier concentration, against experimental data.  We now show how this model is being used to screen new transparent conducting materials for low-cost photovoltaics.

The PdGa intermetallic compound emerged recently for its remarkable catalytic properties in the purification of the feedstock for polyethylene production. PdGa has an intrinsically chiral structure and can be grown in either enantiomeric forms. Recent striking experimental observations reveal a subtle difference in the enantioselectivity of the PdGa(111) and the PdGa(-1-1-1) termination with respect to adsorption of 9-ethynylphenanthrene. This poster presents the challenges recently encountered by atomistic modeling (based on density functional theory and on Monte Carlo simulations) in unravelling the origin of the experimental findings.

<br />
Kapitza resistance (R) between few-layer graphene (FLG) and water is systematically studied using molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast to monoatomic liquid/solid interfaces, R between FLG and water is found to decrease with temperature. The R exhibits a distinct dependence on the thickness of the FLG and the water layer that is attributed to large differences in their phonon mean free path. The density layering of the water near the interface has a significant impact on R with higher water density corresponding to a lower R. Based on these findings we propose two mechanisms to regulate the water layering as means to engineer the thermal transport properties of solid-liquid interfaces.

We carry out numerical radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the near surface layers of the Sun using the facilities at CSCS. The simulations reproduce the well known granular structure of the solar surface with excellent fidelity. Simulations with magnetic fields also reproduce magnetic bright points in the intergranular space as is observed on the Sun. Simulations without magnetic fields show tinier non-magnetic bright points, which have not been observationally detected so far but our simulations predict their existence and basic physical properties of them. The simulated model atmospheres also serve for the computation of synthetic polarimetric intensity maps.

The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method is effectively used in many scientific simulation codes. We present variants of an in place bucketsort algorithm for the PIC method targeting GPUs. In order to optimise performance data locality is required. This relies on efficient sorting algorithms. We discuss the different datastructures that are used where particles are distributed to buckets or stored contiguously. Finally, we show that the performance increases with the amount of storage provided and with the orderliness of the particles. The overall PIC algorithm performs at its best if the sorting is applied.

Green Kubo formulas have never been used in combination to a fully ab initio framework in order to compute the thermal conductivity of liquids. We derive here an expliticit expression for the adiabatic energy current, the key quantity in the Green-Kubo formalism, within density-functional theory and ready to be implemented in ab initio plane-wave based codes. The resulting methodology is demonstrated, as a proof of principle, by comparing ab initio and classical molecular simulations of a model liquid-Argon system, for which accurate inter-atomic potentials are derived by the force-matching method. A first application to liquid water is also presented.

In our talk we will present a reusable approach for poting 200K line Fortran codebase onto GPU: SixTrack model - the LHC Accelerator Beam Dynamics, a part of BOINC Distributed Volunteer Computing project at CERN. The model has been adapted to compile both with host compiler and CUDA Fortran. The problem of insufficient resource of parallelism is solved by performing ensemble simulations. GPU version executes most of the code on device, one block per simulation. Kernel intermixes single-threaded and parallel code portions implemented by postprocessing CUDA code at LLVM IR level. CPU and GPU performances are compared on standard SixDesk test set.

The formation and evolution of planetary systems involves a variety of physical processes acting over a range of timescales. Here, we focus on simulations of terrestrial planet formation. We give an overview of formation models, relevant physics, and how simulations on HPC platforms drive the research. We then describe how these simulations are highly chaotic, such that identical initial conditions can rapidly diverge due to variations in the ordering of compute operations. This has implications for the predictive power of individual runs and suggests that a statistical approach is required.

A central task of the 'DIAPHANE' PASC project is to develop a
library of radiation and neutrino transport routines for astrophysical and cosmological simulations. Applications span a wide range: supernovae, the formation of planets, black holes, stars, and galaxies, and many other problems where progress has been limited by the importance of efficient modeling of radiation or neutrino transport. The library includes algorithms for both optically thick and optically thin gas allowing for 'adaptive' radiative transfer modelling. I demonstrate its current functionality and discuss some of the challenges and strategies in making the library portable enough for multiple codes.

We present a framework to calculate high-order series expansions for quantum lattice models which allows to exploit the many levels of parallelism offered by today's supercomputers. Using this framework, we performed high-order high-temperature series expansions for frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg and Bose-Hubbard models on various lattice geometries.

<br />
Polarizability effects play a major role in many biological processes from effects at lipid bilayers to protein folding. We developed a new method for modeling of polarizability effects in Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). Based on a Drude oscillator model, we first implemented a new coarse-grained water model and applied it to simulations of water-membrane systems. Following that, we developed a model for simulations of proteins, which is based on the polarization of the protein backbone and a simplified representation of the sidechains. We believe that the new models can significantly expand the application range of DPD into the field of computational biophysics.

Astrophysical numerical radiation hydrodynamic simulations often show shock fronts, contact discontinues, or steep gradients across which radiative transfer needs to be computed. In view of applications to the solar atmosphere, we here propose a new method for performing radiative transfer of polarized light through a discontinuous atmosphere using methods of shock capturing hydrodynamics. We use slope-limiter methods for the reconstruction of the source function.

<br />
<br />
The magnetoelectric monopole - a term appearing in the expansion of the interaction energy of the magnetic field H with the magnetization density - is formally allowed to exist in materials with broken time-reversal and inversion symmetry and is related to the response of diagonal magnetoelectrics. By exploiting similarities to the modern theory of polarization, we develop a theory of bulk monopolization and implement a Wannier function-based calculation in first-principles simulations. We compare the values obtained in the bulk picture to values obtained in a local moment picture and point out the relevance of each description.

Interesting non-Abelian states, e.g., the Moore-Read Pfaffian and the anti-Pfaffian, offer candidate descriptions of the nu= 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state. To study the phase diagram of the nu= 5/2 state we numerically diagonalize a comprehensive effective Hamiltonian describing the fractional quantum Hall effect of electrons under realistic conditions in GaAs semiconductors. We conclude that the ground state is in the universality class of the Moore-Read Pfaffian state, rather than the anti-Pfaffian for small Landau level mixing strength. Our findings have important implications for the identification of non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states.

We propose a new, first order numerical scheme for the approximation of incompressible Euler equations. This scheme has a number of interesting properties, which mimic the behaviour of the governing equations. We also propose a procedure, which allows a consistent approximation of admissible measure valued solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate statistical convergence of quantities of interest.

<strong>Computing Entries of Inverse Matrices in Genomic Prediction Problems</strong>, Fabio Verbosio (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)

Genomic prediction problems for plant breeding require scalable and efficient techniques for the solution of sparse linear systems where the matrices involved contain both a large sparse and a dense block. A selective inversion process is suggested that consists of two main steps. First, the selective inverse of the sparse block is computed via the PARDISO solver. Secondly, the Schur-complement of the dense block is computed in parallel and it is used to update the entries of the matrix obtained at the first step. This approach allows the efficient evaluation of selected entries of the inverse, hence its trace that is essential for the solution of the associated maximum likelihood problem.

<strong>Discrete Duality Finite Volume (DDFV) Method Applied to COSMO Horizontal Diffusion</strong>, Sandie Moody (University of Geneva, Switzerland)

<i>Co-authors: Martin Jakob Gander (University of Geneva, Switzerland); Oliver Fuhrer (MeteoSwiss, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
At present, the horizontal components of the subgrid scale flux divergence of the averaged equation for mass of water constituents are not being calculated in the COSMO-Model. This is due to the discretization, whos stability is limited. We propose a new approach, namely a coupling of the DDFV and finite volume methods, to be implemented in the COSMO-Model. Our results show that the DDFV method is well adapted to the COSMO-Model as it is stable on any grid type, in particular a terrain-following grid including steep slopes. We also analyse computational costs and convergence rates.

Hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and Intel MICs, provide a huge performance potential for HPC applications. However, due to different hardware architectures and development frameworks, taking full advantage of every device and creating manageable code is becoming a challenging task. Dynamic Kernel Scheduler (DKS) provides host application with an interface to schedule communication and task execution on the device and handles all the device and framework specific details necessary to execute these tasks on the accelerator. The concepts and first version of DKS will be presented as well as first results of integrating DKS in different applications (FFT Poisson, MC, Chi-square).

<br />
<br />
Parallel-in-time methods have been shown to provide a promising approach to additional concurrency for solving time-dependent problems. However, little is known about their performance in metrics beside speedup. In the future, energy-to-solution for example will become one of the key aspects to judge a method's performance on an HPC system. The poster presents results investigating the Parareal method with respect to its energy efficiency using different parallelization paradigms. A simple theoretical model for the expected energy efficiency is compared against measurements to distinguish between overhead from Parareal's intrinsic limit on parallel efficiency and other sources.

<strong>Higher-Order Quasi-Monte Carlo for Bayesian Inversion of Parametric PDEs</strong>, Robert Gantner (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

<br />
We consider multiparametric partial differential equations to which we apply the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. A diffusion equation with distributed, parametric coefficient is considered as model problem. Applications include uncertainty quantification in groundwater flow and shape uncertainty computations. Such problems involve high- or infinite-dimensional integrals, requiring both suitable methods and their massively parallel implementation. We focus here on novel higher-order QMC methods, explaining their efficient construction and their massively parallel application to the problems at hand. Numerical examples consider a parametric space with up to $s=1024$ dimensions.

We present a pre-release version of HPC.m - the MATLAB HPC Compiler. HPC.m transforms simple MATLAB scripts in a few seconds into massively parallel near peak performance applications for CPU-, GPU- and MIC-supercomputers. The MATLAB scripts must employ basic syntax and follow a few simple rules. We have successively deployed this software in the development of supercomputing applications for the Piz Daint at CSCS in Lugano, Switzerland. We have shown real-world applications work, as for example a non-linear poro-visco-elasto-plastic 3D solver. Our code achieves near peak performance and scales linearly up to more than 2000 GPUs allowing for a spatial resolution of over 2000^3 grid points.

We study time and energy to solution of electronic structure simulation in terms of a model that relates application performance to machine parameters. We focus on the generalised eigenvalue problems for dense matrices, and study distributed memory architectures with multi-core CPU and hybrid CPU-GPU nodes. The model explains, under certain conditions, the empirically observed affine relationship between node-hours and the energy to solution consumed by the computation. It allows us to extract an effective dynamic energy and static power (which we relate to effective leakage) for the application running on different architectures.

We present a high-performance implementation for the solution of the space
inhomogeneous and time dependent Boltzmann equation. The phase space is discretized using finite elements for the physical domain and a polar spectral discretization based on Laguerre polynomials in velocity. Computations are done in 2+2+1 dimensions with an implicit/explicit split time stepping scheme on unstructured meshes. The polar spectral scheme requires no truncation in velocity and conserves mass, momentum and energy. Dirichlet type boundary conditions are included into a least squares formulation. Results for supersonic gas flows in complicated geometries will be presented.

The methods are aimed at hiding network latencies for high performance computing using large compute clusters. We demonstrate their effectiveness on synthetic problems and practical examples for nonlinear mantle convection with heterogeneous viscosity structure.

The scattering of acoustic and electromagnetic waves are important phenomena in many physical models. The boundary element method naturally reduces the wave propagation in exterior domains into a model on the surface of the object. The potential benefits for simulation of large-scale engineering problems can only be achieved with additional fast algorithms. The open-source library BEM++ provides an advanced computing platform for scattering analysis of general 3D structures. We will present ongoing developments and demonstrate its applicability to large-scale scattering phenomena with simulations of high-intensity focused ultrasound modalities for medical treatment of liver cancer.

The exponential random graph model (ERGM) is a statistical model for analyzing social networks.  However, estimating ERGM parameters is a computationally intensive procedure that imposes severe limits on the size of networks that can be fitted.  Recently, it has been shown that conditional estimation can be used to estimate ERGM parameters by estimating parameters for smaller conditionally independent subsets of the network. Snowball sampling can be used to generate such subsets. A large number of relatively small samples can be estimated in parallel, taking advantage of parallel computing to allow estimation of much larger networks than previously possible.

The goal of a scientist running simulations on top of exascale systems is to take advantage of the latest HPC technologies which are likely to guarantee better performances. Yet, its goals are to solve scientific problems rather than associated software engineering tasks. We introduce ExaShark, a large-scale n-dimensional array toolkit offered as a high-level library for scientists to help computing exascale simulations. It particularly integrates Patus for preprocessing applications that need stencil computations. While ExaShark handles the distributions of the grid using a plethora of back-end communication protocols, Patus computes optimized stencils on inner regions of the grid.

We present a coupled reactive transport code that uses the open-source, multi-platform, multi-physics Finite Element package OpenGeoSys for solving flow and transport equations and the Gibbs Energy Minimization (GEM) based chemical solvers GEMS3K and Reaktoro for obtaining chemical equilibrium speciation. The coupled code can be used to simulate systems from lab to some extend field scale with very complex chemistry (e.g. several non-ideal solution phases in the system). The code runs on various platforms, including massively parallel systems where it uses an overlapping domain decomposition approach in combination with execution of multiple threads for solving chemical equilibria.

Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets have to be solved numerically. Existing algorithms approximate the law of motion of aggregate variables parametrically using a limited number of moments of the cross-sectional distribution. They do not take full advantage of the stationary state distribution. In this paper, a computable expression for the exact law of motion is introduced which leads to the equilibrium's stationary state distribution. The algorithm, a hybrid of projection and perturbation methods, is shown to converge. Furthermore, approximation and convergence issues of some existing algorithms are rationalized.

<br />
One of the challenges in economics is to learn about the causality relations based on available data. The presence of unresolved scale quantities may result in  non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the data-driven models. They can manifest themselves in a presence of trends, regime-transition behavior and lead to biased results when applying standard stationary causality inference approaches used in Economics (e.g., Granger causality, an approach that was distinguished with a Nobel prize in Economics in 2003). The main aim of this project is implementing an HPC-framework for multiscale causality inference and testing it on a set of the credit rating data of increasing complexity.

<br />
<br />
<b>Abstract</b><br />
The need of advanced materials for sustainable energy resources and next generation information technology requires the development of integrated scientific strategies, encompassing theoretical innovations, and computational and laboratory experiments. Substantial progress has been made in the last two decades in understanding and predicting the fundamental properties of materials and molecular systems from first principles, i.e. from numerical solutions of the basic equations of quantum mechanics. However the field of ab initio predictions is in its infancy; some formidable theoretical and computational challenges lie ahead of us, including the collection and use of data generated by simulations. We will describe recent progress and successes obtained in predicting properties of matter by quantum simulations, and discuss algorithmic challenges in connection with the use of evolving high-performance computing architectures. We will also discuss open issues related to the validation of the approximate, first principles theories used in large-scale quantum simulations.
<br />

There is growing concern that the energy cost to produce weather forecasts, to quantify their uncertainty, and to handle the associated I/O load from enhanced observing systems as well as large forecast ensembles will be unaffordable with current HPC and data management technologies. NWP centres face enormous challenges due to the rising cost of energy associated with running complex high-resolution models on more and more processors in time for delivering forecasts with substantial societal benefit.

This paper presents an extension of the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) type schemes for the non-hydrostatic compressible Euler equations in conjunction with two and three-dimensional unstructured meshes. The schemes are suitable for regional and global climate models dynamical cores. Their potential lies in their simplicity; accuracy; robustness; non-oscillatory properties; versatility in handling any type of grid topology; computational and parallel efficiency. The WENO schemes (up to 5th -order) are applied to two- and three-dimensional test cases: a 2D rising thermal bubble; the 2D density current and the 3D Robert smooth bubble.

Many geophysical fluid dynamics problems feature a noticeably smaller extension in the vertical dimension compared to the horizontal dimensions. For such scenarios, we evaluate the potential of 2.5D grids that extend dynamically adaptive triangular meshes by a
uniformly refined third dimension. While we tolerate a slight increase in the total number of degrees of freedom, we aim at improved performance due to vectorisation along the vertical dimension. Examples will be presented for simulation of tsunamis and porous media flow.

<br />
The solution of the Euler equations by high-order spectral elements is prone to instabilities that must be damped in some way. We approach the problem of stabilization via an adaptive subgrid-scale scheme meant to treat the instabilities by modeling the sub-grid scale features of the flow. The equations are regularized via a dynamically adaptive stress proportional to the residual of the unperturbed equations. Its effect is close to none where the solution is smooth and it increases elsewhere. This is a first step toward LES for hurricanes and extreme weather forecast with the Nonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere, NUMA, the dynamical core of the next-generation Navy model NEPTUNE.

<strong>Advances in Numerics and Physical Modeling for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics</strong><br />
<br />
In view of the ever increasing parallelism of supercomputing platforms and the approaching era of exascale computing, high-resolution modeling is becoming a priority for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) numerical modelers. Today's supercomputers require highly scalable numerical methods; high-resolution permits more resolved physical processes. This mini-symposium aims to bringing together scientists from different disciplines who are contributing to the next-generation GFD model development via the definition of advanced numerical methods and more accurate physical schemes. Interest is given to scalable numerics and high-resolution physics modeling such as, but not limited to, LES.

I will present a highly parallelizable and flexible computational method to solve high-dimensional stochastic dynamic economic models. Solving such models often requires the use of iterative methods, like dynamic programming. The solution method I will present includes the use of a fully adaptive sparse grid algorithm and the use of a mixed MPI-Intel TBB-CUDA/Thrust implementation to improve the interprocess communication strategy on massively parallel architectures.  Numerical experiments on 'Piz Daint' (Cray XC30) at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre show that high-dimensional international real business cycle models up to at least 50 countries can be solved efficiently.

The evolution of  strategic interaction, competition, and market power have been some of the central issues in  the field of industrial organization. However, most of the analysis has been confined to simplified models since solving dynamic models with heterogenous firms, market entry and exit, investment are quite difficult. In this paper we introduce a numerical method for computing equilibria of dynamic  multi-firm competition game with endogenous productivity, uncertain demand and entry/exit.

Mirrlees (1971) first formulated optimal taxation of a heterogeneous population as the solution to a bi-level optimization problem. This formulation is practical to solve only when people differ in a single dimension. The multidimensional problem lacks an organizing principle to simplify an otherwise enormous number of constraints, and solutions often do not satisfy constraint qualification. We present a method to circumvent these issues by decomposing the problem into two steps: one-time creation of a reusable sample of the impacts of various policies and a quick search that takes an interchangeable distribution function over the heterogeneity and finds the corresponding optimal policy.

Economic models frequently lead to polynomial systems of equations or polynomial optimization problems. Although the literature on computational algebraic geometry has made great progress in solving polynomial systems of equations and polynomial optimization problems, many difficulties remain. In particular, currently we can only solve rather small problem instances on computers. In this talk, we will review some economic applications of polynomial methods and discuss some current technical limitations.

<strong>Emerging Applications of Computation in Economics</strong><br />
<br />
Clearly, the world economy is an extremely complex system. Even when modeling only the most relevant features of a small part of this system, one easily ends up with a large and intricate formal structure. A further complication stems from the fact that human beings choose their actions based on expectations about an uncertain future. This feedback from the future makes economic modeling particularly difficult. This symposium provides an overview of recent developments in how state-of-the art computational economical modeling tackles these issues in the fields of macroeconomics, optimal taxation, game theory, climate change, and growth models.

A Bayesian Model is proposed as framework to decode the organizational principles of the brain anatomy. This problem aims at investigating how tissue properties ('trait') in the brain manifold predict 'states' represented by clinical variables. Our Bayesian Model deals with the problem of mapping thousands of multivariate variables to a small dimensional space having different sets of data informing the same model. We used the idea of 'Streaming Variational Bayes' approach based on different model evidences to tackle this difficulty. This framework is ideal when Neuroimaging data coming from different Hospitals are not allowed to be used due to confidentiality reasons.

Biological modeling is important to study the evolution of genes and organisms. The increased availability of genomic data is pushing for the development of HPC approaches to model evolutionary processes. The availability of Bayesian approaches has been essential to extend the realism of the evolutionary models. The development of these methods based on MCMC techniques is computationally intensive and requires HPC approaches to deal with the computational complexity. I will present recent work to optimize and parallelize MCMC techniques. I will discuss our efforts to extend modeling of adaptation from genomic data to complex phenotypic traits using hierachical Bayesian computations.

Coevolving sites play a critical role the structure and function of a protein. I have recently developed two methods for the detection of such signature. The first method is a combinatorial and compares the homologous sequences whereas the other method is probabilistic and looks for the evolution of amino acids along the specie tree. The latter was implemented in a ML and Bayesian framework. I applied both methods on a large set of proteins. Among these proteins, I took particular care to analyze the Amyloid B protein that is implied in Alzheimer disease. The method revealed that well-known fragments of the protein are co-evolving revealing an evolutionary signature in this protein.

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies and advances in bioengineering, the field of experimental evolution is developing novel approaches that allow for unique opportunities to study adaptation. In particular, genetic mutations can be systematically engineered and tracked in bulk population competitions, allowing for the simultaneous assessment of hundreds of mutational effects. Here, we present a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach that allows for the estimation of fitness effects and experimental power from such large-scale data. Results are presented in the framework of classical evolutionary models, many of which can now be experimentally evaluated.

<strong>Bayesian Life Science Models </strong><br />
<br />
The development of Bayesian methods in health sciences and biology has increased tremendously over the past decades since they learn about the data by exploring different hypothesis based on a priori knowledge. These models are computationally demanding and may require several million of iterations to reach convergence. Very few algorithms have explored the possibilities of using HPC approaches to speed up Bayesian methods. In this meeting we aim to provide an opportunity to bring together world experts in the fields of Bayesian statistics and HPC, to discuss the potential of new methodologies, and to investigate how to build Bayesian models that meet HPC platform requirements.

The simulation of atmospheric dynamics relies on the numerical solution of the Euler equations. We consider here sound-advection systems for stratified fluids. These systems exhibit wave type solutions which impose CFL-based restrictions on the time step size. Buoyancy, sound and advection cause separate restrictions each on their own scale. We develop Finite Volume Methods where a splitting approach allows different treatment of fast and slow waves. The methods are optimized with respect to order and maximum stable CFL numbers. Different scenarios for the scales of sound and advection are discussed.

<br />
<br />
Inexact spectral deferred correction (SDC) method for solving non-stiff initial value problems (IVPs) are addressed. In many IVPs the approximate evaluation of the right hand side (rhs) is obtained much faster. This allows us to exploit the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost in evaluation of rhs. Error propagation in the SDC method is studied to obtain expressions of global errors w.r.t. local errors. Work models relating local errors to computational costs are derived. Error and work models are combined to obtain an adaptive tolerance selection by minimizing total work. Inexact SDC is then tested on long-time integration of damage evolution in oscillatory fatigue problems.

I will report on the construction of a temporal integration scheme designed to be used with a higher-order finite-difference spatial approximation to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation with perfectly matched layer boundary conditions for the paraxial wave equation. The temporal method is based on a semi-implicit spectral deferred corrections approach coupled with an alternating direction implicit (ADI) approximation to the (linear) implicit terms. The accuracy and efficiency of the methods, as well as a discussion of space-time parallelization of the method will be presented.

Applications using finite element meshes often require regions of refinement to honor small-scale features. These localized smaller elements create a bottleneck for explicit time-stepping schemes due to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition. Recently developed local time stepping (LTS) algorithms reduce the impact of these small elements by locally adapting the time-step size to the size of the element. The multi-level nature of LTS introduces a strong load imbalance across processors. We examine the use of multi-constraint graph and hypergraph partitioning tools to achieve effective, load-balanced parallelization for CPUs and GPUs implemented in the seismology package SPECFEM3D.

<strong>Increasing Computational Efficiency for Temporal Integration </strong><br />
<br />
The temporal integration of ordinary or partial differential equations is a fundamental computational problem in many application areas such as molecular dynamics, weather and climate, structural mechanics, combustion, cosmology, and many others. This minisymposium will present innovative strategies for realizing better computational efficiency in cases where the temporal direction creates a computational bottleneck. Topics include exploiting disparate time scales in the governing equations, applying techniques from multigrid in the time direction, and using time parallel algorithms like parareal and PFASST.

I will present our last developments to model multifrequency radiation hydrodynamics within the adaptive-mesh-refinement code RAMSES (Teyssier 2002). We employ the flux-limited-diffusion approximation and use a combination of explicit (for hydrodynamics) and implicit (for radiation transport) schemes, as well as an efficient scheme for adaptive-time-stepping. I will present our numerical implementation and the tests we have performed. Last, I will present application to star formation problems (protostellar collapse).

Two algorithms to solve the time dependent radiation (magneto)hydrodynamic equations will be described. The first method solves the two radiation momentum equations, which are closed with the variable Eddington tensor based on time-independent radiative transfer equation using short characteristics. The second method solves the time-dependent radiative transfer equation for specific intensities directly based on finite volume method. Both methods are accurate for both optically thick and optically thin regimes and can be used to model both gas pressure and radiation pressure dominated flows. Application of both methods to study black hole accretion disks will also be described.

Many astrophysical studies require an highly accurate treatment of radiation transport to properly determine heating and cooling timescales, observables, or dependent physical properties. At the same time the radiation transport algorithm should be as fast as possible to allow for an efficient usage of computing resources. Hybrid approaches try to combine the accuracy of a high-order radiation transport method with the speedup of sensible approximations.
Exemplary, I will present the theory and numerics of our own hybrid radiation transport scheme developed for hydrodynamical studies of star formation and accretion disks. Benchmark tests and science applications will be addressed.

We present a chemistry-coupled radiative transfer scheme for the magnetohydrodynamical simulation code FLASH4. We briefly describe its design philosophy and implementation, and show how non-equilibrium effects captured by the on-the-fly solution of a fast hydrogen chemical network changes the expansion behavior of ionization fronts obtained from simpler approximations. We characterize the differences by modeling a massive star embedded in a molecular clump and furthermore look at the combined expansion of ionization- and photon dominated region (PDR) fronts. We find that the pre-heating by UV-photons changes the stability of the shell typically found around HII regions.

<strong>Radiative Transfer in Astrophysics; Methods and Applications to Multi-Scale Simulations</strong><br />
<br />
We plan to organize a Mini-Symposium focused on presenting and discussing methods and applications of radiative transfer in multi-scale simulations of astrophysical systems. The subject is timely as it reflects the main theme of the ongoing 'DIAPHANE' PASC project. Radiative transfer is the current bottleneck of multi-scale simulations across a wide range of scales and problems, from planet formation to galaxy formation and cosmological reionization. State-of-the-art methods employed in the major particle-based and grid-based codes worldwide will be presented and their range of application critically discussed. We will foster discussion of innovative algorithmic strategies.

This talk will focus on the efficient solution of porous media flow problems with discontinuous Galerkin methods. For the fast solution of the linear systems arising in the elliptic flow equation a hybrid preconditioner based on subspace correction in the conforming finite element subspace is employed. The transport equation is solved with explicit methods as part of an operator splitting scheme for the coupled system. The performance of the implementation based on the sum factorization approach is assessed on various architectures and computational results for density-driven flow and miscible displacement are presented.

High-order (HO) finite element (FE) discretizations are a natural fit for future HPC hardware. In this talk we present our work on scalable HO FE software that combines the modular FE library MFEM (mfem.googlecode.com), the hypre library of linear solvers (llnl.gov/casc/hypre), and the HO shock hydrodynamics code BLAST (llnl.gov/casc/blast).  We discuss the FE abstractions provided by MFEM, the use of hypre data structures/kernels for efficient parallel assembly, and demonstrate the benefits with respect to scaling/GPU acceleration in BLAST. We also consider HO adaptive refinement and present recent work on scalable algebraic multigrid for electromagnetic problems in this context.

The numerical study of electromagnetic wave propagation in interaction with nanometer scale structures generally relies on the  solution of the system  of time-domain Maxwell  equations, taking into account an appropriate physical dispersion model  for characterizing the material properties of the involved  nanostructures at optical frequencies. In this talk, we will present our  recent efforts aiming at the design of high performance Discontinuous Galerkin Time-Domain (DGTD) methods for 3d nanophotonic applications. We will consider more particularly DGTD methods for solving  the system of Drude-Maxwell equations.

This talk gives an overview of SeisSol's performance. SeisSol solves the elastic wave equations with a ADER-DG-FEM. Together with hardware-aware optimizations on three generations of CPUs and the Xeon Phi coprocessor, the talk covers a broad range of characteristics and strategies common to high order DG-FEMs. At single-node level we present a detailed study including the cross-architecture influence of the convergence order, clock frequency and vector instruction set on time- and energy-to-solution. The second part shows our completely redesigned communication scheme aiming at overlapping communication and computation on homogeneous supercomputers in a very natural way.

<strong>Recent Advances on Scalable High-Order Finite Element Type Schemes for PDEs</strong><br />
<br />
The availability of exaflop computers will enable the numerical treatment of more challenging physical problems. However, the simulation of such complex physical phenomena will require very accurate and scalable numerical schemes. In this context, the objective of this minisymposium is to address these needs for different types of PDE models underlying challenging physical problems from modern computational sciences. Related topics are among others, high order or spectral accuracy, space and time adaptivity, finite element methods, finite volume methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, multiscale methods, stencil codes, etc.

The central goal of ExaStencils is to develop a radically new software technology for applications with exascale performance. To reach this goal, the project focusses on a comparatively narrow but very important application domain of stencil codes. The aim is to enable a simple and convenient formulation of problem solutions in this domain. The software technology developed in ExaStencils shall facilitate the highly automatic generation of a large variety of efficient implementations via the judicious use of domain-specific knowledge in each of a sequence of optimization steps such that, at the end, exascale performance results.

Projected from today, exascale computers are characterized by billion way parallelism. Computing on such extreme scale needs methods with perfect scaling and optimal complexity. The solver itself must be of optimal numerical complexity - a requirement becoming more and more severe with increasing problem size - and scale efficiently on extreme scales of parallelism. We will present a multigrid approach scaling efficiently unto the full size of the largest computers available and looks promising for even larger scales. We further show that robustness can be maintained during the scaling process for relevant application problems while still maintaining optimal complexity.

Exascale systems are expected to exhibit much higher degrees of parallelism in terms of number of cores per node. While OpenMP is used today for exploiting parallelism on the level of individual nodes, it is unclear how well OpenMP implementations will scale to much higher numbers of threads. In this work, we apply automated performance modeling to examine the scalability of OpenMP constructs across different compilers and platforms, such as Intel Xeon multi-board, Intel Xeon Phi, and Blue Gene with compilers from GNU, IBM, Intel, and PGI.
The resulting models reveal a number of scalability issues in implementations of OpenMP constructs and show unexpected differences between compilers.

The Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) is a well-established scheme in quantum physics to determine eigenvalue density and spectral properties of large sparse matrices. We demonstrate the high performance potential of KPM on heterogeneous CPU-GPU supercomputers. At the node level we perform optimizations which transform our sparse matrix problem towards pure data streaming with high computational intensity. All optimizations are guided by a performance modelling process that indicates how computational bottlenecks change. The optimized KPM code is embedded in a hybrid-parallel framework to perform large scale KPM calculations on Piz Daint (CRAY XC30) achieving 0.5 PF on 4096 nodes.

Computational science has seen a meteoric rise in the scope, breadth, and depth of its efforts. Notwithstanding this prevalence and impact, it is often still performed using the renaissance model of individual artisans gathered in a workshop, under the guidance of an established practitioner. Great benefits could follow from adopting concepts and tools coming from computer science to manage, preserve, and share these computational efforts. I will illustrate here our vision for the four pillars that should sustain such effort (the ADES model: Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing) and discuss their implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform (http://www.aiida.net).

Climate science is highly data intensive and data is the raw material for the scientist for gaining new insights. The German Climate Computing Centre DKRZ stores dozens of Petabyte of modelling output on disks and tapes. Costs for this part of the infrastructure are increasing and we look into methods of how to reduce them. The talk will introduce the most important aspects of data management within climate science and cover various aspects during the lifecycle of data. We will explain how a well-balanced HPC system needs to be configured and which investment and operational costs are generated by it. A look at Exascale systems will conclude the presentation.

The raw data rate at  the LHC is 1 Petabyte/sec. In terms of  production, capturing, communicating, aggregating, storing and analyzing it this is arguably the biggest and most challenging science data frontier and one that offers solutions for other fields and affords innovation as we move to the next era of the High Luminosity LHC when the needs and requirements can be an order magnitude bigger. I will discuss Big and Smart Data  and intelligent data handling systems  in high energy physics  as we move forward towards the High Luminosity LHC and beyond and highlight the importance of validation and verification that we can afford in this science domain.

<strong>Big Data Analytics in Science</strong><br />
<br />
Big Data driven scientific discovery presents a new paradigm next to theory, experimentation and simulation. It relies on the foundational concept of discovery pipelines that start with data acquisition and curation, introduce knowledge representation and exploration and finally lead to scientific discovery. Thus, data flow as well as advanced and deep analytic algorithms and new appropriate computer architectures will be central in our discussion. This new paradigm challenges the state of the art in Big Data and computing, as it demands unprecedented degrees of integration and interoperability as well as new levels of combined computational and data centric performance.

The talk will present recent results on the applicability of the time-parallel Parareal algorithm to the in-silico modeling of permeation of chemicals through human skin. For our analysis we use a brick-and-mortar setup as a model problem. A C++ library implementing Parareal is combined with the ug4 simulation framework, which provides the spatial discretization and parallelization. By numerical examples, we investigate Parareal's performance on an anisotropic domain with large jumps in the diffusion coefficients. While speedup from the time parallelization is shown to be possible, load balancing is identified as an important aspect.

We present and discuss an application of the parallel-in-time integration method Parareal to the Einstein gravity equations for a collapsing massless scalar field in spherical symmetry. We show that Parareal captures the correct black hole formation event and generates the proper mass scaling law. Moreover, if the computational load is properly balanced in time, Parareal features speedup when compared to the serial two-step Lax-Wendroff Richtmyer scheme. As we are using a two-level approach in both space and time, we furthermore analyze the influence of the spatial interpolation. Finally, the efficiency of different Parareal implementations is compared with respect to energy consumption.

In this talk we examine an optimal-scaling parallel time integration method, multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT). MGRIT applies multigrid to the time dimension by iteratively solving all time steps simultaneously. This results in a non-intrusive approach that wraps existing time evolution codes. MGRIT allows for various time integrators, adaptive refinement/coarsening in time and space and handles non-linear problems through FAS multigrid. Aspects of the theory, software implementation in the XBraid library (llnl.gov/casc/xbraid), and practical result for a variety of problems will be presented, e.g., explicit/implicit time integration, non-linear diffusion and compressible Navier-Stokes.

Iterative parallel-in-time integration methods like the 'parallel full approximation scheme in space and time' (PFASST) provide parallelism along the temporal axis by integrating multiple time-steps simultaneously. Along the line of a high-order Boris-SDC integrator for charged particles in external magnetic fields we present the evolution of three implementations of PFASST. Starting from a prototyping Python framework, we explain different implementation strategies and conceptual challenges. We then present results using the HPC library libpfasst and describe our new, lightweight PFASST++ code, highlighting the lessons learned from the interplay with existing HPC applications.

<strong>Increasing Computational Efficiency for Temporal Integration </strong><br />
<br />
The temporal integration of ordinary or partial differential equations is a fundamental computational problem in many application areas such as molecular dynamics, weather and climate, structural mechanics, combustion, cosmology, and many others. This minisymposium will present innovative strategies for realizing better computational efficiency in cases where the temporal direction creates a computational bottleneck. Topics include exploiting disparate time scales in the governing equations, applying techniques from multigrid in the time direction, and using time parallel algorithms like parareal and PFASST.

We present a new scheme for radiative transfer.  The goals are a fast approach (low cost, no timestep constraints) for an approximate radiation field to drive chemistry and heating for many potential applications.  The method combines ray tracing and the tree method.  It is flexible in terms of geometry and can use multiple wave-bands.  It has been implemented in the GASOLINE2 code but is modular and could be added to different code types.  The result scales well with source numbers and is cheap for sub-regions (i.e. multiple timesteps).  We demonstrate test results for ionizing radiation (HII regions) and shadowing tests.  We show first results on some astrophysical applications.

I will talk about the radiative transfer (RT) code TRAPHIC (TRAnsport of PHotons In Cones). TRAPHIC is a multi-frequency RT code for use in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. It solves the time-dependent RT equation by tracing photon packets emitted by source particles at the speed of light and in a photon-conserving manner through the simulation box. 
While the unique design of TRAPHIC makes it ideal for cosmological simulations with large number of sources, it is a general purpose ionizing RT code, and as I will show with several examples, has already been successfully employed in a range of problems.

<br />
I present an implementation of radiation-hydrodynamics in the RAMSES code, which models the emission and propagation of radiation and its interaction with gas via ionisation, dissociation, heating, dust-scattering, and momentum transfer. We use moment-based radiative transfer, which has the advantage over ray-based implementations of handling an unlimited number of radiation sources without an effect on the computational load. I discuss the basic aspects of the implementation, highlighting advantages and disadvantages, and show examples where it has been used in studies of radiation feedback, the emission properties of the circum-galactic medium, and the escape of UV radiation from galaxies.

<strong>Radiative Transfer in Astrophysics; Methods and Applications to Multi-Scale Simulations</strong><br />
<br />
We plan to organize a Mini-Symposium focused on presenting and discussing methods and applications of radiative transfer in multi-scale simulations of astrophysical systems. The subject is timely as it reflects the main theme of the ongoing 'DIAPHANE' PASC project. Radiative transfer is the current bottleneck of multi-scale simulations across a wide range of scales and problems, from planet formation to galaxy formation and cosmological reionization. State-of-the-art methods employed in the major particle-based and grid-based codes worldwide will be presented and their range of application critically discussed. We will foster discussion of innovative algorithmic strategies.

The accurate representation of the heterogeneities of the subsurface requires using high order numerical methods based on unstructured meshes. Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (DGM) are becoming very popular in the geophysicist community, but they still have to be improved to tackle realistic 3D configurations. Issues are different regarding the equation regime. In time domain, stability depends on a penalization parameter and efficiency of the code requires task-based programming to take advantage of heterogeneous architecture. In harmonic domain, the size of the global DG linear system is huge and Hybridizable DG methods are a promising framework to reach reasonable dimensions.

<br />
<br />
Matrix-free finite element operator evaluation for quadratic and higher order hexahedral bases has been shown to be faster per degree of freedom than sparse matrix-vector products for linear elements. The key to success is substituting a memory intensive kernel by fast tensorial integration in a way that suits modern hardware. Our shared-memory implementation dynamically schedules integration tasks on non-conflicting cells and faces, offering coloring, partitioning, and more abstract flow graph concepts. Results show that hardware trends with a growing number of cores per memory controller and widening vector units require particular emphasis on memory access patterns into solution vectors.

Hyperbolic conservation laws are important mathematical models for describing many phenomena in physics or engineering.  The Discontinuous  Galerkin (DG) methods is a popular method for solving conservation laws. We present how we have implemented the DG method in the OpenCL/MPI framework in order to achieve high efficiency on recent GPU or multicore processors. The implementation relies on a splitting of the DG mesh into sub-domains and sub-zones. Different kernels are compiled according to the zones properties. In addition, we rely on the OpenCL asynchronous task graph in order to overlap OpenCL computations, memory transfers and MPI communications.

We discuss an object oriented design of finite element core functionality. It allows to separate the mathematical definition of the finite element basis functions, the efficient implementation of operations, and the calculation of stiffness matrices and residual vectors. We show how features of the C++11 programming language help to reduce code complexity and thus allow for additional performance optimization such as vectorization.The presented techniques are implemented in the open source finite element package NGSolve.
We present examples including matrix-free solvers and high order tent-pitching methods for conservation laws.

<strong>Recent Advances on Scalable High-Order Finite Element Type Schemes for PDEs</strong><br />
<br />
The availability of exaflop computers will enable the numerical treatment of more challenging physical problems. However, the simulation of such complex physical phenomena will require very accurate and scalable numerical schemes. In this context, the objective of this minisymposium is to address these needs for different types of PDE models underlying challenging physical problems from modern computational sciences. Related topics are among others, high order or spectral accuracy, space and time adaptivity, finite element methods, finite volume methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, multiscale methods, stencil codes, etc.

We present the performance engineering process for a FETI-DP application (2D nonlinear hyperelasticity) used in the SPPEXA project EXASTEEL. Starting from a pure MPI code we incrementally develop a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallel approach that allows efficient utilization of current multi-core compute nodes. The PETSc+MPI-based finite element assembly is parallelized with OpenMP and as a multithreaded direct solver we have chosen Pardiso. This hybrid parallel approach can extend the scalability range of FETI-DP methods by up to a factor of four. Besides a multi-core scaling analysis each step is accompanied with single-core runtime analysis revealing relevant performance bottlenecks.

DUNE is a software framework for the flexible construction of solvers for PDEs.  It has been used successfully on up to O(10^6) cores using MPI. In the EXA-DUNE project we make DUNE suitable for EXA-scale computing.  This includes using shared-memory parallelism, wide SIMD units, and accelerator devices while requiring minimal changes in the way users of the framework implement their solvers.  In addition, some applications require new numerical methods to overcome restrictions like limited memory and bandwidth. Solving these challenges gives us a set of methods, which we present here.  They allow constructing applications that take advantage of EXA-scale computers.

Massively parallel simulation codes will have to be able to handle faults in the coming age of exascale computing. Faults are predicted to occur in the time-span of minutes or even below. 
We employ the combination technique for the simulation of hot fusion plasmas. It numerically decomposes a single and huge problem into many, but small partial problems that can be computed in parallel. This hierarchical splitting provides a new handle to treat faults without checkpoint-restart at the cost of sligthly slower convergence or slightly higher error. Furthermore, our algorithm-based fault tolerance does not depend on expensive recomputations of missing solutions.

Fluid-Structure-Acoustics Interactions are one example for multiphysics simulations featuring a high model accuracy but also high computational costs which requires the use of massively parallel computers. Whenver we want to ensure flexibility in adding or exchanging physical fields and solver or set up a new model combination in a short timerange, such simulations use a partitioned approch combining independent existing single-physics solvers. We present functionalities, efficient numerics and parallelization strategies that we implemented in our coupling library preCICE comrising the complete functionality required to combine codes to a multiphysics simulation environment.

The importance of data analytics, management, sharing and preservation of very big, often heterogeneous or distributed data sets - besides the basic technical requirements transfer and storage - is of increasing significance for science, research and industry. The John von Neumann Institute for Computing, a joint institute by DESY, GSI and Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany, is going to establish a call for project submission in the field of scientific big data analytics (SBDA). The goal is to extend and optimize the existing HPC and data services. A call for expressions of interest has been launched in order to identify and analyze the needs of the scientific communities.

Traditionally, the discovery of new materials is extremely labor-intensive. This approach is not scalable and as such this field of research is ideally suited for a big data based cognitive computing approach. In this talk, we will present how this approach is applied in practice. We will discuss in detail the various aspects ranging from the used data-models to the algorithms applied. Special attention will be given to the design and construction the knowledge graph, which encodes the underlying data and knowledge model. We will discuss in detail how the nodes and edges in the graph are designed and how the algorithms can be used to refine and optimize the edges of the graph.

Communication remains the most significant bottleneck in the performance of distributed optimization algorithms for large-scale machine learning. We propose a communication-efficient framework, COCOA, that uses local computation in a primal-dual setting to dramatically reduce the amount of necessary communication. We provide a strong convergence rate analysis for this class of algorithms, as well as experiments on real-world distributed datasets with implementations in Spark. In our experiments, we find that as compared to state-of-the-art mini-batch versions of SGD and SDCA algorithms, COCOA converges to the same .001-accurate solution quality on average 25× as quickly.

Hierarchical Bayesian modeling provides an inference framework to fuse heterogeneous data into engineering applications. Hierarchical models suffer from extensive computational demands arising from multiple model evaluations and data intensity. We tackle both challenges using our parallel framework for uncertainty quantification. We combine state of the art parallelized sampling schemes to achieve multiple levels of nested parallelism and manage large data volumes generated by the simulations. We demonstrate our approach to the calibration of Pharmacokinetic models using heterogeneous experimental data measurements on supercomputing platforms.

Big Data driven scientific discovery presents a new paradigm next to theory, experimentation and simulation. It relies on the foundational concept of discovery pipelines that start with data acquisition and curation, introduce knowledge representation and exploration and finally lead to scientific discovery. Thus, data flow as well as advanced and deep analytic algorithms and new appropriate computer architectures will be central in our discussion. This new paradigm challenges the state of the art in Big Data and computing, as it demands unprecedented degrees of integration and interoperability as well as new levels of combined computational and data centric performance.

An efficient implementation of stencil computations requires code transformations such as loop tiling and loop fusion. In the course of the HP2C project we developed the STELLA stencil library that goes a long way in applying efficient code transformations for different target architectures. Nevertheless, STELLA still requires some manual tuning. In this talk, we introduce MODESTO, a model-driven stencil optimization framework, that for a stencil program suggests program transformations optimized for a given target architecture. Using a compile-time performance model and mathematical optimization we successfully tune example stencils of the COSMO atmospheric model.

Many applications in media processing, control, graphics, and other domains require efficient small-scale linear algebra computations. However, most existing high performance libraries for linear algebra, such as ATLAS or Intel MKL, are geared towards large problems (matrix sizes in the hundreds and larger). We present LGen: a compiler for small-scale, basic linear algebra computations. The input to LGen is a fixed-size linear algebra expression; the output is a corresponding C function optionally SIMD-vectorized. We show benchmarks against libraries (e.g., Intel MKL) and alternative generators (e.g., C++ template-based Eigen). The typical speedup is about a factor of two to three.

<br />
In this talk, we present AnyDSL, a compiler-framework that allows to define arbitrary domain-specific abstractions in the form of a library. AnyDSL allows to express hierarchies of abstractions and efficient transformation to lower-level abstractions through refinement. At the lowest level, the code can be optimized via exposed compiler functionality such as partial evaluation or target code generation.
Further, we will present a DSL for stencil codes that achieves the same performance as hand-optimized implementations on CPUs as well as on GPUs.

Project ExaStencils aims to develop a code generator which generates high performance multigrid stencil codes for a certain class of problems. Going from the continuous mathematical high-level description of the problem down to highly optimized low-level code requires to make choices which make the description more concrete and, in the end, yield a fast code. ExaStencils has defined 4 layers of domain-specific languages at different levels of abstractions to express these choices. In this talk, we give an overview of the current state of the language layers, the code generator and the use of domain knowledge in the code transformations and optimizations.

<strong>Domain Specific Compilation for Scientific Computing </strong><br />
<br />
Languages and compilation strategies that exploit domain specific knowledge are well known as effective tools for the automatic generation of optimized program code. However, the increasingly complex heterogeneous hardware at the core of todays HPC platforms as well as the large base of existing HPC applications makes the use and integration of domain specific compilation techniques challenging. In this symposium, we present and discuss recent approaches that address the challenge of domain specific optimizations in the context of heterogeneous systems, scientific computing problems as well as the integration of domain specific languages with existing code bases.

Recent studies have shown that arising big data analytics problems cannot be performed at economically affordable energy if we rely on the traditional scaling of Von-Neumann microprocessors based on Moore's law. A drastic reduction of energy consumption requires the transition from the current computing-centric model to a more data-centric model in which data is pushed to functional units tailored to the specific workload requirements. In this talk, we present an architecture for such a near-data processing approach and show initial results that unveil the energy-efficiency of custom processing pipelines implemented in reconfigurable hardware.

Finite difference methods are widely used, highly parallel algorithms for solving differential equations. While simple from a computational point of view, these algorithms are hard to implement efficiently because their performance is essentially memory-bound. In this talk we discuss how the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method for solving Maxwell's equations can be translated to custom data-flow engines implemented on FPGAs. We evaluate our work with a case study from the computational nanophotonics domain and show that the resulting solution provides both, performance and energy-efficiency benefits over CPU and GPU implementations.

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can achieve significant acceleration over traditional processor-based solutions. Unfortunately, their inaccessible programming model, which is inherited from circuit design and far from software-like productivity, is probably the main reason for many users to stay away from FPGAs. In this talk, I will present a cost-effective approach to develop domain-specific high-level synthesis tools. In particular, we leverage domain-specific languages (i.e., designed to specify applications within a particular domain, e.g., machine learning) to express the application at a high abstraction level while enabling the automatic generation of efficient hardware.

<strong>Accelerating Scientific Computing with FPGAs</strong><br />
<br />
Since the performance of CPUs started to stagnate, computing with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has attracted significant interest. FPGAs not only provide massive parallelism and but also allow for fully customizing the processing architecture to the application through a software programming process. As a result, FPGAs can outperform CPUs in speed and energy-efficiency by orders of magnitude for many applications. In this symposium we will bring together leading experts in FPGA computing with computational scientists with a selection of talks that elaborate on the foundations, programming approaches and case studies of the applications of FPGAs for scientific computing.

Design and implementation of solvers that scale to large HPC systems is not only a challenge from a numerical point of view, but also - and even more so - from an implementation and verification point of view. To estimate how a newly developed solver would behave on modern heterogeneous HPC architectures, knowledge of many different programming paradigms and libraries is needed. ExaShark's goal is to reduce the increasing programming burden while still offering good performance.

In  this talk we will discuss possible numerical remedies to survive data loss in some numerical linear algebra solvers namely Krylov subspace linear solvers and some widely used eigensolvers. Assuming that a separate mechanism ensures fault detection, we propose numerical algorithms to extract relevant information from available data after a fault. After data extraction, well chosen part of missing data is regenerated through interpolation strategies to constitute meaningful inputs to numerically restart. We will also present some preliminary investigations to address soft error detection again at the application level in the conjugate gradient framework.

We propose an approach that allows current solvers to adapt to future architectures and continue to scale at exascale, and this by removing the bottleneck introduced in the communication process. Our objective is to increase the arithmetic intensity, that is the number of floating-point operations performed per bytes fetched in the memory during the execution of the solvers, indeed reduce the number and the volume of the data exchanged among the  processors and the memory. We use the help of efficient stencil compilers such as PLUTO and PATUS to increase the arithmetic intensity of these solvers.

We would like to present a massively parallel implementation of the Hybrid Total Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) method, which is designed to solve extremely large problems using multilevel decomposition combined with communication hiding techniques.  In Hybrid FETI a relatively small number of neighboring subdomains is aggregated into clusters and each cluster is processed by a single compute node. This method significantly reduces main bottleneck of the two level FETI caused by solving the coarse problem. As of now the solver is able to solve problems larger than 4.3 billions of unknowns using 720 compute nodes with 64 GB of RAM.

<strong>Integrating Resilience and Communication Hiding/Avoiding in a Extreme Scale Preconditioned Krylov Solver </strong><br />
<br />
We report the progress of the Exascale Algorithms and Advanced Computational Techniques (Exa2CT) project funded by the European Union. In this project resilience and communication avoiding/hiding techniques are integrated in a preconditioned Krylov solver for exascale applications. We use the pipelining to hide the latencies of the global reductions, stencil compilers to increase the arithmetic intensity and avoid communication at the level of the preconditioner. Resiliency to soft errors is also discussed. We report initial benchmarks of the components and the integrated prototypes on various proto applications ranging from combustion to mechanics.

IP4 <strong>Computational Challenges in Macroeconomics</strong>, Thomas Sargent (New York University, USA)
<br /><br />
<i>Chair: Felix Kübler (University of Zurich, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
<b>Abstract</b><br />
Modern macroeconomic theory has provided many qualitative insights into the functioning of financial and labor markets in our complex modern economies. But determining the quantitative importance of frequently countervailing forces requires much more than the pencil and paper methods used by economic theorists. My talk will describe some  new economic ideas brought by economic theory and how efforts to develop computational tools promise to  help macroeconomists perform  quantitative analyses that can inform policy choices.
<br />
<br />
<b>Biography</b><br />
Thomas J. Sargent is the W. R. Berkley Professor at New York University, a joint appointment in the Economics Department and the Stern School of Business. He has been a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution since 1987. He was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Economics for his empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy. Professor Sargent earned his BA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964, and his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1968. He has held Professor appointments at the University of Minnesota, University of Chicago, and Stanford University. Sargent was elected a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences in 1983.

IP5 <strong>Towards Exascale Simulation of Turbulent Combustion</strong>, Jacqueline Chen (Sandia National Laboratories, USA)
<br /><br />
<i>Chair: Gretar Tryggvason (University of Notre Dame, USA)</i>
<br />
<br />
<b>Abstract</b><br />
Exascale computing will enable combustion simulations in parameter regimes relevant to next-generation combustors burning alternative fuels. The first principles direct numerical simulations (DNS) are needed to provide the underlying science base required to develop vastly more accurate predictive combustion models used ultimately to design fuel efficient, clean burning vehicles, planes, and power plants for electricity generation. However, making the transition to exascale poses a number of algorithmic, software and technological challenges. As Moore's Law and Dennard scaling come to an end exascale computing will be achieved only through massive concurrency. Addressing issues of data movement, power consumption, memory capacity, interconnection bandwidth, programmability, and scaling through combustion co-design are critical to ensure that future combustion simulations can take advantage of emerging computer architectures. Co-design refers to a computer system design process where combustion science requirements influence architecture design and constraints inform the formulation and design of algorithms and software. The current state of petascale DNS of turbulent combustion will be reviewed followed by a discussion of current combustion exascale combustion co-design topics: 1) architectural modeling and simulation of the behavior of combustion applications on future extreme architectures; and 2) programming model and runtime for heterogeneous, hierarchical machines with inherent variability. While bulk synchronous programming and data parallelism have been operative at the petascale, the movement to exascale requires a shift towards asynchronous programming, where to extract maximum parallelism, both data and task parallelism accessing disjoint sets of fields is required. An example from a recent refactorization of a combustion DNS code, S3D, using an asynchronous model, Legion, with dynamic runtime analysis at scale will be presented.
<br />

<b>Biography</b><br />
Jacqueline H. Chen is a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at the Combustion Research Facility at Sandia National Laboratories. She has contributed broadly to research in petascale direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent combustion focusing on fundamental turbulence-chemistry interactions. In collaboration with computer scientists and applied mathematicians she is the founding Director of the Center for Exascale Simulation of Combustion in Turbulence (ExaCT). She received several DOE INCITE Awards in the last few years and the Asian American Engineer of the Year Award in 2009.

Adapting weather and climate models to current and emerging hardware architectures is a formidable challenge. We present the design decisions, implementation, performance results and learnings from an effort to re-design an existing, widely used community code (COSMO) to hybrid architectures. Using the concrete example of MeteoSwiss' next-generation operational forecasting system, we illustrate the gains in scientific possibilities, time-to-solution and energy-to-solution.

<br />
<br />
Convection-resolving models (CRMs) operate at very high resolution (grid spacing between 1 and 3km) where convective processes (i.e., thunderstorms and rain showers) can be explicitly represented. The use of CRMs is feasible in numerical weather prediction since recently, but is computationally challenging in climate applications. Here we present pilot CRM climate simulations at horizontal resolution of 2.2km across a greater Alpine region conducted on a Cray XE6 system using a setup with 2000 cores on a grid of 500x500x60 points. The results demonstrate the importance of high resolution in climate simulations for assessing short-term precipitation events.

Climate simulations using horizontal resolution of O(1km) allow to explicitly resolve deep convection. Precipitation processes are then represented much closer to first principles and allow for an improved representation of the water cycle. We present a set of convection-resolving simulations covering the European-scale using a COSMO-model prototype enabled for GPUs, integrated on a computational mesh of 1536x1536x60 grid points. Results illustrate the interactions between synoptic-scale and meso-scale atmospheric circulations, and the initiation of new convective cells by propagating cold pools. Furthermore we discuss computational benefits from using GPUs for climate simulations.

Reliable atomistic modeling of complex life-science systems has so far been limited by the sizes and time scales accessible by molecular simulations. In this talk, we will present a radical and innovative approach to enable the application of quantum simulations to biological domains typical of classical Hamiltonians. Our approach will merge the extensive knowledge accumulated in the field of semi-empirical quantum simulation and the latest development in low-complexity and scalable algorithms, allowing us to exploit modern supercomputers efficiently and to achieve high scalability and low time to solution. Details of the methodology and efficiency will be discussed.

Organogenesis is a dynamic, self-organizing process. Many of the individual regulatory components, e.g. signalling molecules and their regulatory interactions, have been identified in experiments. However, an integrative mechanistic understanding of the regulatory processes is missing. Computational modelling provides a formalism to formulate and test hypotheses. We present and discuss an according Turing model for the simulation of branching morphogenesis and focus on its numerical challenges. Finally, we show a quantitative comparison between simulated- and real branching morphogenesis in vitro, acquired at the D-BSSE Single Cell Facility.

Large groups of fish in the ocean often swim in recognizable patterns. One line of thought identifies 'schooling' as an evolutionary means to dissuade attacks from predators. There is also speculation that such behavior  may bestow a hydrodynamic advantage to swimmers. The mechanism of reduction in the required energy input may arise from interactions between the leaders' wake, and the undulatory motion of the following-swimmers. The goal of this study is to probe this possibility, by numerically re-creating swimming behavior  observed in experiments. In preliminary studies, both the leader as well as the follower have been observed to experience an increase in swimming efficiency.

The combination of density functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean field (DMFT) has become a popular method for first principles studies of strongly correlated materials. Yet, one of the most severe drawbacks of the method is the double counting of correlations that have been included in both, DFT and DMFT, and that so far could be removed only by introducing an empirical parameter. Assuming that DFT and DMFT produce the exact density, we devise a method to derive the double counting correction from first principles. We validate it on metals, charge transfer and Mott insulators, and find that in all cases the predicted correction to be in agreement with the accepted values.

The Nanomesh (nm) is the Moire-like structure formed by a single hBN layer grown on Rh. It can be functionalized by sputtering ions, while the pristine form can be recovered by annealing. Argon implantation  leads to the formation of vacancy and interstitial defects. The interstitials  are atoms trapped beneath the sp2 layer. The vacancies  are formed when B and  N atom are kicked out by  Ar ion impact. DFT-based optimisations and MD to provide better understanding of the observed phenomena. We go beyond the static picture and address the defect formation kinetics, their mobility, leading to aggregation and eventually the self-healing of the sp2 lattice. H.Y. Cun et al. ACS Nano 8 (2014)

Solid state electrolyte transporter for Lithium ions are of great importance in the design of highly efficient batteries. In this study we investigate the static and dynamical properties of a new class of ceramic electrolytes based on the Garnet structure that exhibits the unprecedented combination of high ionic conductivity and chemical stability. Using data from ab-initio metadynamics combined with thermodynamic integration we parametrized a kinetic Monte Carlo model for the characterization of the transport properties at ambient conditions. This model is the starting point for the design of better performing materials using machine learning and data mining techniques.

Many codes and pseudopotentials (PP) are available and attempts to evaluate errors inside simulations have been made. We compare equations of state (EOS) using various libraries of PP inside the DFT code QUANTUM Espresso with all-electron data. A PP is considered good when the squared deviation of the two EOS is small. Using these values, together with the energy cutoffs required to converge phonons, heats of formation, and computational costs, we propose two libraries, called Standard Solid State Pseudopotentials (SSSP), with focus on efficiency and accuracy. We use the SSSP and a screening technique based on stability and bandgap to search for novel light harvesting rare-earth perovskites.

Based on first-principles calculations, we propose a microscopic model that explains the reversible lithiation/delithiation of tin-oxide anodes in Li-ion batteries. At the point when the irreversible regime ends, the anode is ordered and consist of layers of Li-oxide separated by Sn bilayers. During the following reversible lithiation, the Li-oxide undergoes two phase transformations, which give rise to a Li-enrichment of the oxide and the formation of a SnLi composite. The predicted anode volume expansion and voltage profile agree well with experiments, contrary to existing models.

Diamond-like carbon films are considered very promising materials for resistive random access memories. The information is stored by setting different level of electric resistance in amorphous carbon (a-C). An electric pulse is used to switch between the low and the high resistance states. The current challenge is to ensure reversible switch in a-C. We use atomistic simulations at the realistic device sizes to find which structural changes produce the resistance switch and its associated optimal process conditions.

The efficient analysis of large-scale scientific data demands interactive rendering techniques unconstrained by bus bottlenecks or memory limits. This favors CPU-based solutions over accelerators (GPUs). Ray-tracing provides the ideal method, supporting a variety of primitives and naturally incorporating ambient occlusion as a view-point neutral lighting strategy. Our contributions are novel algorithms for coherent and incoherent ray-traversal that significantly outperform previous solutions. We demonstrate the efficiency of our core algorithms implemented in shared and distributed memory rendering systems with the capability of rendering billions of primitives interactively.

DBCSR is a sparse matrix library designed to efficiently perform sparse matrix-matrix multiplication, among other operations. It is MPI and OpenMP parallel, and can exploit accelerators. It is developed as part of CP2K, where it provides core functionality for linear scaling electronic structure theory. The multiplication algorithm is based on Cannon's algorithm, whose scalability is limited by the MPI communication time. We present a novel implementation based on a 2.5D algorithm, which takes in account the sparsity of the problem in order to reduce the MPI communication.

In the late 1990s, mostly economic reasons led to the adoption of commodity processors in high-performance computing. This transformation has been so effective that in 2015 the TOP500 list is still dominated by x86-based supercomputers. In 2015, the largest commodity market is the one of smartphones and tablets, most of which are built with ARM-based SoCs. This leads to the suggestion that once mobile SoCs deliver sufficient performance, mobile SoCs can help reduce the cost of HPC. In view of the experiences within the Mont-Blanc project, this talk will describe possibilities, results and challenges raised when developing HPC platforms from mobile embedded technology.

We present the new version of the Global Braginskii Solver (GBS) a code addressing tokamak boundary turbulence. GBS employs a 3D cartesian communicator and a parallel multigrid Poisson/Ampere solver, achieving excellent parallel scalability, and it is being ported into manycore and hybrid architectures. Two new capabilities resulted from improved algorithms: the inclusion of electromagnetic fluctuations at realistic plasma size, and a non-Boussinesq Poisson operator for the electrostatic potential. Simulations of the turbulent plasma dynamics are benchmarked against state-of-the-art imaging diagnostics in tomakak experiments, showing remarkable agreement in many observables.

Our focus is to port Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes applied for studying turbulence in magnetic fusion relevant plasmas to various computational platforms equipped with GPUs and MICs. To this end, a so-called 'PIC ENGINE' framework containing the main features of the PIC algorithm has been designed and implemented with different approaches ensuring the locality of the method. Our implementation on the GPU is done using the OpenACC parallel programming standard. The algorithmic performance is tested on the Cray XC30 - Piz Daint - platform. Results show that our optimizations lead to significant performance improvements and will be compared to a reference parallel OpenMP implementation.

In the last years there has been a change of paradigm within the SPH calculations. What was considered as 'standard' in SPH has been renewed by a set of recent formalisms that have helped to overcome various long-lasting inherent problems of this numerical technique. These new additions include, among others, the use of new kernels resistant against pairing instability, and more accurate gradient calculation via an integral approach. In this talk I will focus in how these simple changes can substantially improve our SPH calculations at almost no cost.

Aeroelasticity considers the joint effects of aerodynamic, elastic and inertial forces. This discipline initially relied on analytical methods to model the underlying physics. Later on, low-fidelity methods such as doublet-lattice became the  standard.
High-fidelity, CFD-based approaches are of course possible but  demanding, as, unlike most engineering disciplines, they require time-accurate simulations, often used to feed convenient Reduced-Order-Models. Availability of HPC might soon allow practitioners to systematically capture flow non-linearities in full. We would like to present the state of art and the current trends.

We present Large-Eddy simulations (LES) of the combustion chamber of a scram jet experiment with finite rate chemistry, using only the fundamental chemical reaction equations. The main focus of this work is to provide necessary guidance to the mesh resolution needed to perform a full-domain numerical simulation of a three-dimensional scram jet, which is M=7 experimental aircraft. The combustion process modeled by the finite rate chemistry is based on the notion that it can be resolved on a larger scale than the levels needed to resolve turbulence.

Simulation of cloud cavitation collapse pertains to the erosion of liquid-fuel injectors, hydropower turbines and ship propellers, or can even be harnessed in treating kidney stones by shock wave lithotripsy. Cavities undergo a collapse at higher pressure regions inside the flow and produce extreme pressure spots, possibly causing erosion. Numerical simulations of cloud cavitation collapse require two phase flow solvers capable of capturing interactions between multiple deforming bubbles. We present the two-phase flow simulations enabling quantitative prediction of cavitation of clouds containing up to 50'000 vapor bubbles on unprecedented resolution of up to 1 trillion grid points.

IP6 <strong>Algorithmic Adaptations to Extreme Scale</strong>, David Keyes (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia)
<br /><br />
<i>Chair: Olaf Schenk (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
<b>Abstract</b><br />
Algorithmic adaptations are required to use anticipated exascale hardware near its potential, since the code base has been engineered to squeeze out flops. Instead, algorithms must now squeeze out synchronizations, memory, and transfers, while extra flops on locally cacheable data represent small costs in time and energy. Today's scalable solvers, in particular, exploit frequent global synchronizations. After decades of programming model stability with bulk synchronous processing (BSP), new programming models and new algorithmic capabilities (to take advantage, e.g., of forays in data assimilation, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification) must be co-designed with the hardware. We briefly recap the architectural constraints, highlight some work at KAUST, and outline future directions.
<br />
<br />
<b>Biography</b><br />
David Keyes is Director of the Extreme Computing Research Center at KAUST. He earned a BSE in aerospace and mechanical sciences from Princeton in 1978 and PhD in applied mathematics from Harvard in 1984. Keyes works at the interface between parallel computing and the numerical analysis of PDEs, with a focus on scalable implicit solvers. Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS), Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Inexact Newton (ASPIN), and Algebraic Fast Multipole (AFM) methods are methods he helped name and popularize. Before joining KAUST as a founding dean in 2009, he led scalable solver software projects in the ASCI and SciDAC programs of the US Department of Energy, ran university collaboration programs at NASA's ICASE and the LLNL's ISCR, and taught at Columbia, Old Dominion, and Yale Universities. He is a Fellow of SIAM and AMS.

The goal of FWI is to estimate a model  (velocity) of the subsurface from measurements of the ground?s responses to seismic vibrations. FWI is known to be a challenging inverse problem that contains many local minima and can be ill-posed.  FWI is computationally demanding;  estimating a model that accurately predicts the measurements requires a large number of simulations each of which is obtained from solving the Helmholtz equation over many sources and frequencies.  We will show how to design an inversion code that can work well for small to medium size problems and can be scaled up to large scale problems. Special emphasis will be put on Julia's potential to distribute the PDE solves amongst all available workers.</span></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> Agenda</td> <td> <table border="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"><span style="font-size: x-small;">14:30 - 15:00</span></td> <td><span style="font-size: x-small;">Introduction to FWI (Eldad Haber)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><span style="font-size: x-small;">15:30 - 16:15</span></td> <td><span style="font-size: x-small;">Numerical Optimization in Julia (Lars Ruthotto)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><span style="font-size: x-small;">16:15 - 17:15</span></td> <td><span style="font-size: x-small;">Computer Lab 1: Serial FWI</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><span style="font-size: x-small;">17:15 - 17:45</span></td> <td><span style="font-size: x-small;">Parallel Computing in Julia (Lars Ruthotto)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><span style="font-size: x-small;">17:45 - onwards</span></td> <td><span style="font-size: x-small;">Computer Lab 2: Distributed FWI</span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The US, like the EU and other countries, is engaged in a national initiative that aims to deploy exascale computing platforms early in the next decade. The outlines of such platforms are starting to emerge. We shall survey, in our talk, the current roadmap for exascale computing and the main challenges this roadmap entails. We shall also discuss the likely evolution of HPC beyond exascale, in the &quot;post-Moore&quot; era.</p>

<p><strong>Large Scale Computation in Seismic Exploration</strong>; Dave Nichols (Schlumberger Limited, USA)</p>
<h3><strong><br /></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Seismic exploration for oil and gas has been one of the largest commercial users of high performance computing for more than 50 years. We record petabyte datasets and use analysis and imaging techniques that require large-scale wave equation modelling. The problem size, and ambition level, of this modelling had increased regularly over the years. However, despite the many changes in computer architectures the methods used have been quite stable for at least 15 years. We have chosen to use explicit time-domain finite-difference methods on many different hardware platforms. I will discuss why this has been so successful and whether any current and future trends will require us to move to other computational methods.</p>

<strong>Automatic Global Multiscale Seismic Inversion: Insights into Model, Data, and Workflow Management</strong>, Michael Afanasiev (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

<br />
<br />
Modern global seismic waveform tomography is formulated as a PDE-constrained nonlinear optimization problem, where the optimization variables are Earth's visco-elastic parameters. This particular problem has several defining characteristics. First, the solution to the forward problem, which involves the numerical solution of the elastic wave equation over continental to global scales, is computationally expensive. Second, the determinedness of the inverse problem varies dramatically as a function of data coverage. This is chiefly due to the uneven distribution of earthquake sources and seismometers, which in turn results in an uneven sampling of the parameter space. Third, the seismic wavefield depends nonlinearly on the Earth's structure. Sections of a seismogram which are close in time may be sensitive to structure greatly separated in space.<br /><br />
In addition to these theoretical difficulties, the seismic imaging community faces additional issues which are common across HPC applications. These include the storage of massive checkpoint files, the recovery from generic system failures, and the management of complex workflows, among others. While the community has access to solvers which can harness modern heterogeneous computing architectures, the computational bottleneck has fallen to these memory- and manpower-bounded issues.<br /><br />We present a two-tiered solution to the above problems. To deal with the problems relating to computational expense, data coverage, and the increasing nonlinearity of waveform tomography with scale, we present the Collaborative Seismic Earth Model (CSEM). This model, and its associated framework, takes an open-source approach to global-scale seismic inversion. Instead of attempting to monolithically invert all available seismic data, the CSEM approach focuses on the inversion of specific geographic subregions, and then consistently integrates these subregions via a common computational framework. To deal with the workflow and storage issues, we present a suite of workflow management software, along with a custom designed optimization and data compression library. It is the goal of this paper to synthesize these above concepts, originally developed in isolation, into components of an automatic global-scale seismic inversion.

We present a new open-source cosmological code, called SWIFT, designed to solve the equations of hydrodynamics using a particle-based approach (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) on hybrid shared / distributed-memory architectures. SWIFT was designed from the bottom up to provide excellent <em>strong scaling</em> on both commodity clusters (Tier-2 systems) and Top100-supercomputers (Tier-0 systems), without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized accelerator hardware. This performance is due to three main computational approaches: (i) <em>Task-based parallelism</em> for shared-memory parallelism, which provides fine-grained load balancing and thus strong scaling on large numbers of cores; (ii) <em>Graph-based domain decomposition</em>, which uses the task graph to decompose the simulation domain such that the <em>work</em>, as opposed to just the <em>data</em>, as is the case with most partitioning schemes, is equally distributed across all nodes; (iii) <em>Fully dynamic and asynchronous communication</em>, in which communication is modelled as just another task in the task-based scheme, sending data whenever it is ready and deferring on tasks that rely on data from other nodes until it arrives.<br /><br /> In order to use these approaches, the code had to be re-written from scratch, and the algorithms therein adapted to the task-based paradigm. As a result, we can show upwards of 60% parallel efficiency for moderate-sized problems when increasing the number of cores 512-fold, on both x86-based and Power8-based architectures.

We summarize the optimization and performance evaluation of the Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) on two different types of supercomputers: the K computer and TSUBAME2.5. First, we evaluated and improved several kernels extracted from the model code on the K computer. We did not significantly change the loop and data ordering for sufficient usage of the features of the K computer, such as the hardware-aided thread barrier mechanism and the relatively high bandwidth of the memory, i.e., a 0.5 Byte/FLOP ratio. Loop optimizations and code cleaning for a reduction in memory transfer contributed to a speed-up of the model execution time.
The sustained performance ratio of the main loop of the NICAM reached 0.87 PFLOPS with 81,920 nodes on the K computer. For GPU-based calculations, we applied OpenACC to the dynamical core of NICAM. The performance and scalability were evaluated using the TSUBAME2.5 supercomputer. We achieved good performance results, which showed efficient use of the memory throughput performance of the GPU as well as good weak scalability. A dry dynamical core experiment was carried out using 2560 GPUs, which achieved 60 TFLOPS of sustained performance.

The effective integration of models with data through Bayesian uncertainty quantification hinges on the formulation of a suitable likelihood function. In many cases such a likelihood may not be readily available or it may be difficult to compute. The Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) proposes the formulation of a likelihood function through the comparison between low dimensional summary statistics of the model predictions and corresponding statistics on the data. In this work we report a computationally efficient approach to the Bayesian updating of Molecular Dynamics (MD) models through ABC using a variant of the Subset Simulation method. We demonstrate that ABC can also be used for Bayesian updating of models with an explicitly defined likelihood function, and compare ABC-SubSim implementation and efficiency with the transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC). ABC-SubSim is then used in force-field identification of MD simulations. Furthermore, we examine the concept of relative entropy minimization for the calibration of force fields and exploit it within ABC. Using different approximate posterior formulations, we showcase that assuming Gaussian ensemble fluctuations of molecular systems quantities of interest can potentially lead to erroneous parameter identification.

We design a new implicit solver for the Junction-Generalized Riemann Problem (J-GRP), which is based on a recently proposed implicit method for solving the Generalized Riemann Problem (GRP) for systems of hyperbolic balance laws. We use the new J-GRP solver to construct an ADER scheme that is globally explicit, locally implicit and with no theoretical accuracy barrier, in both space and time. The resulting ADER scheme is able to deal with stiff source terms and can be applied to non-linear systems of hyperbolic balance laws in domains consisting on networks of one-dimensional sub-domains. Here we specifically apply the numerical techniques to networks of blood vessels. An application to a physical test problem consisting of a network of 37 compliant silicon tubes (arteries) and 21 junctions, reveals that it is imperative to use high-order methods at junctions, in order to preserve the desired high-order of accuracy in the full computational domain.

Accurate characterization of the cardiac activation sequence can support diagnosis and personalized therapy in heart-failure patients. Current invasive mapping techniques provide limited coverage. Our aim is to estimate a complete volumetric activation map from a limited number of measurements. This is achieved by optimising the local conductivity and early activation sites to minimise the mismatch between simulated and measured activation times. We modeled the activation times using an eikonal equation, reducing computational cost by 3 orders of magnitude compared to more physiologically detailed methods. The model provided a sufficiently accurate approximation of the activation time and the ECG in our patients. The solver was implemented on GPUs. Since the fast-marching method is not suitable for this architecture, we used a simple Jacobi iteration of a local variational principle. On a single GPU, each forward simulation took less than 2 seconds, and the inverse problem was solved in a few minutes.

The ever-increasing available computational power allows for solving more complex physical problems spanning multiple physical domains. We present a numerical tool for simulating fluid-structure interaction between blood flow and the soft tissue of heart valves. Using the basic concept of the Immersed Boundary Method, the interaction between the two physical domains (flow and structure) does not require mesh manipulation. We solve the governing equations of the fluid and the structure with domain-specific finite difference and finite element discretisations, respectively. We use a massively parallel algorithmic framework for handling the L2-projection transfer between the loosely coupled highly parallel solvers for fluid and solid. Our tool builds on a well-established and proven Navier-Stokes solver and a novel method for solving non-linear continuum solid mechanics.

<br />
In this talk, we present an eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) to simulate the fluid-structure interaction arising from a 3D flexible thick structure immersed in a fluid. Both fluid and solid domains are discretized independently by generating two overlapped unstructured meshes. Due to the unfitted nature of the considered meshes, this method avoids the technical problems related to an ALE approach while maintaining an accurate description of the fluid-structure interface. The coupling between the fluid and solid is taken into account by means of a Discontinuous Galerkin approach, which allows to impose the interface conditions. A possible application is the study of the interaction arising between blood and aortic valve leaflets since it is important for understanding its functional behaviour, for developing prosthetic valve devices and for post-surgery feedbacks.

<br />
<br />
Chiari malformation type I is a disorder characterized by the herniation of cerebellar tonsils into the spinal canal resulting in obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow. The flow of oscillating CSF is acutely complex due to the anatomy of the subarachnoid space. We report first ever direct numerical simulations on patient specific cases with resolutions that border Kolmogorov scales, amounting to meshes with 2 billion cells and conducted on 50,000 cores of the Hazelhen supercomputer in Stuttgart. Results depict velocity fluctuations of 10kHz, turbulent kinetic energy 2x of mean flow energy in Chiari patients while the flow remains laminar in control subject. The fluctuations confine near craniovertebral junction, and are commensurate with the extremeness of pathology and the extent of herniation. The results advocate that the manifestation of pathological conditions like Chiari malformation may lead to transitional CSF, and a prudent calibration of numerics is necessary to capture such phenomena.

<strong>Advanced Computational Methods for Applications to the Cardiovascular System I</strong><br />
<br />
Cardiac and Cardiovascular Mathematics represents nowadays a challenging topic in view of the emerging and growing collaborations between clinicians and mathematicians. In this respect, the numerical solution of problems arising in modelling cardiac and systemic phenomena opens new and interesting perspectives which need to be properly addressed. From the cardiac side, a fully integrated heart model represents a complex multiphysics problem, which is in turn composed of several submodels describing cardiac electrophysiology, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. On the system circulation side, although it has been studied for a longer time, several mathematical and numerical aspects still need to be addressed (e.g., tissue remodelling, atherosclerotic plaque formation, aneurysms development, transitional and turbulence phenomena in blood flows). This minisymposium aims at gathering researchers and experts in computational and numerical modelling of the heart and the systemic circulation.

For a few years, we have been developing in Strasbourg new cosmological simulation tools to study the reionization process. These tools participate to the strong ongoing effort by the community to include the radiative transfer physics in numerical simulations. Given its central role in the transition, one might want to deal routinely with light in the same way as we deal with matter in such codes. However, the inclusion of light is known to be quite challenging in terms of numerical resources and can increase by orders of magnitude the complexity or the numerical requirements of the existing codes. I will present how we were led to use graphics processing units (GPUs) as hardware accelerators to cope with this numerical challenge and I will discuss the methodologies of ATON, a radiative post-processing code and EMMA, a new complete AMR cosmological simulation code, both accelerated by means of graphics devices.

Particle-in-Cell (PIC) codes will be among the first applications to run at the exascale due to their high scalability and excellent data locality. This is especially true for relativistic PIC codes that simulate very fast phenomena where fields are time-advanced along with the particles. However, the time scale covered by these simulations is extremely short and of limited usefulness for magnetic fusion research. The gyrokinetic approximation of the Valsov equation, on the other hand, allows for much larger time scales by mathematically integrating out the fast cyclotron motion of ions in magnetized plasmas. Global gyrokinetic PIC codes, which implement this method, have been very successful but also more challenging to scale than their "classical" counterparts due to the gyrokinetic formulation and the need to solve a Poisson equation. This talk describes several computational schemes that have allowed the GK-PIC codes to overcome some of these issues and scale to petascale.

We present the open-source ecosystem around the reportedly fastest particle-in-cell code in the world (sustained Flop/s), PIConGPU. Designed for modern clusters powered by manycore hardware, we motivate that HPC plasma simulations should be able to estimate their systematic and random error (e.g., by varying solvers and initial conditions). Our approach starts with an open-source, anytime fork-able development cycle as the basis for scrutable and reproducible simulations. To promote interoperability, we develop and propagate an open, self-describing, file-format agnostic data-markup (openPMD) that is suitable for extreme I/O load and in-situ processing, demonstrated in a live simulation. PIConGPU is build on top of C++ meta-programming libraries, providing single-source kernel acceleration (alpaka) to work asynchronously on distributed data containers (PMacc). Using compile-time optimisation techniques, we show that particle-mesh methods can be implemented for arbitrary high-performance hardware (GPGPUs, CPUs, OpenPOWER, Xeon Phi) featuring solver agility without negative implications on maintenance (rewrite) or runtime performance.

With the aim of porting Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes to modern parallel computers equipped with coprocessors, we have designed a testbed called PIC_ENGINE retaining the key elements of the PIC algorithm as applied to plasma physics simulations. A hybrid OpenMP/MPI implementation is used to explore the potential gain in performance on multi-core CPUs and Many Integrated Core (MIC) coprocessors. A bucket sort is added to increase data locality and a vectorization algorithm is implemented showing an improvement in the overall performance. With the PIC_ENGINE, we show that the hybrid OpenMP/MPI approach allows a performance gain of approximately 60% compared to pure MPI. Furthermore, the sorting and vectorization increase the performance of the most time consuming methods by up to a factor 3.2. Finally, using the same code, hybrid runs are performed on MIC and show similar conclusions. However, due to inefficient vectorization, the overall performance is poor compared to CPU runs.

Refactoring large legacy codes to exploit the power of new multithreaded devices is not an easy task. For this purpose, we designed a platform embedding simplified basic features of PIC codes. It solves the drift-kinetic equations (first step towards gyrokinetics) in a sheared plasma slab using B-spline finite elements up to fourth order. Multiple levels of parallelism have been implemented using MPI+OpenMP and MPI+OpenACC. It has been shown that sorting particles can lead to performance improvement by increasing data locality and vectorizing the grid memory access. This paper focuses on GPU implementation, which overtakes CPU timing by up to a factor 4 while not requiring a big code rewriting effort. This gain increases with the splines order. Weak and strong scalability tests have been successfully run on GPU-equipped Cray XC30 Piz Daint (CSCS) up to 4,096 nodes. Those performances shall enable advanced studies of turbulent transport in magnetic fusion devices.

Tracking and identification of particles are amongst the most time-critical tasks in the computing farms of high-energy physics experiments. Many of the underlying algorithms were designed before the advent of multi-core processors and are therefore strictly serial. Since the introduction of multi-core platforms these workloads have been parallelized by executing multiple copies of the application. This approach does not optimally utilize modern hardware. We present two different thread-parallel implementations of a straight-line particle track finding algorithm. We compare our implementations, based on TBB and OpenMP, to the current production version in LHCb's Gaudi software framework as well as a state-of-the-art implementation for general purpose GPUs. Our initial analysis shows a speedup of more than 50% over multi-process Gaudi runs and competitive performance to the GPGPU version. This study allows us to better understand the impact of many-core hardware platforms supplementing traditional CPUs in the context of the upcoming LHCb upgrade.

<strong>Advanced Computing in Plasma, Particle and Astrophysics on Emerging HPC Architectures</strong><br />

Non-traditional computing architectures such as general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) and many-integrated core accelerators are providing leading edge performance for advanced scientific computing. Their advantages are particularly evident when the power cost is considered: The top 10 "green500", where  flops/watt is the ranking criteria, are all heterogeneous machines. Given that power costs are becoming more critical, future capability machines are likely to be dominated by these architectures. Non-traditional architectures may require non-traditional programming models, and the scientific community is still learning how to take full advantage of heterogeneous machines with reasonable programming effort. This difficulty is compounded by the need for sophisticated algorithms to handle the large dynamic ranges encountered in state-of-the-art physics and astrophysics simulations. This minisymposium provides a forum for researchers in the computational plasma, particle physics and astrophysics communities to share their techniques and findings. The presentation and discussion of findings and lessons learned will foment more effective use of these new resources for the advancement of physics and astrophysics.

The complexity inherent in the application of advanced numerics on modern hardware to coupled physical systems presents a critical barrier to simulation development. To overcome this, we must create simulation software which embodies the abstraction and composability of the underlying mathematics. In this way, a system is created in which mathematicians, computer scientists, and application specialists can each deploy their own expertise, benefiting from the expertise of the others. Critically, this approach minimises the extent to which individuals must become polymaths to share in these advances. In this talk I will present Firedrake and PyOP2, a composition of new and existing abstractions which creates a particularly complete separation of concerns. This enables the creation of high performance, sophisticated finite element models from a very high level mathematical specification and has enabled advances in computer science and numerics, while also facilitating the creation of simulation systems for a variety of applications.

The fast-paced environment of high-performance computing architectures has always been a challenge for complex codes. First, the effort to adapt the code to new processor architectures is significant compared to their typical release phase. Second, optimisations for one target often incur performance penalties on others. Third, such codes are generally developed by domain scientists, which typically lack the expertise about specific details of the target platform. Successful projects like STELLA have shown that a way out of this situation is to apply the concept of separation of concerns. GridTools is pushing this concept even further: The domain scientist's work is conducted within a prototyping environment using a domain-specific language (DSL), while the computer scientist profiles the automatically-generated code over diverse architectures, implemented by different hardware-specific backends. This talk will give an overview of the GridTools ecosystem, highlighting the use of the prototyping environment in combination with the automatic-code generation engine.

We have been developing a compiler of PGAS programming language called XcalableMP for post-petascale computing. XcalableMP is a directive-based language extension of Fortran95 and C for scientific programming for high-performance distributed memory parallel systems. Omni Compiler is an infrastructure for source-to-source transformation to design source-to-source compilers such as Omni XcalableMP compiler. It includes C and Fortran95 front-ends which translate a source code to XML-based intermediate code called XcodeML, a Java-based code-transformation library on XcodeML, and the de-compilers which translate XcodeML intermediate code back to transformed source code. Currently, the Omni compiler also supports the code transformation for OpenMP and OpenACC. In this talk, we will present internals of Omni compiler by taking Omni XcalableMP compiler as a case study, and our future plan.

The need for portable efficient climate applications arise from the demand on precise climate and weather modelling. Model codes are growing in complexity and it is difficult to achieve consensus to deliver both high performance with high programmer productivity. GridTools is a C++ template library for applications on regular grids. The user is required to specify the high-level application model and provide the stencil-operators while the library provides optimised backend for underlying computational hardware. This helps to detach model developer from implementation details. Production process becomes more straightforward with early deployment to HPC clusters. Solution of tridiagonal linear systems, typical for implicit schemes such as advection, diffusion and radiation is abundant and performance critical in climate models. We use GridTools library to implement Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Krylov solver, iterative method efficient for solving sparse linear systems. We evaluate performance and compare it to other tools such as PETSc.

The ExaHyPE project employs the high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method in order to solve hyperbolic PDEs on adaptive Cartesian grids at exascale level. Envisaged applications include grand-challenge simulations in astrophysics and geosciences. Our compute kernels rely on tensor operations - a type of operation scientific computing libraries only support to a limited degree. We demonstrate concepts of how the tensor operations can be reduced to dense matrix-matrix multiplications, which is undoubtedly one of the best optimised operations in linear algebra. We apply reordering and reshaping techniques, which enables our code generator to exploit existing highly optimised libraries as back end and produce highly optimised compute kernels. As a result, our tool chain provides a "complete solution" for tensor product-based FEM 'operations'.

As new hybrid HPC architectures are being more common, scientific applications are being adapted to take advantage of these new computing power. Programming standards like OpenACC have been successfully applied to allow parallelism in existing code to be offloaded efficiently on accelerators. Achieving optimal performance on various architectures with a single source code is not always possible. Restructuring the code and applying specific architecture optimisation is often needed to increase the performance. This situation has been observed while porting the COSMO weather model, as well as the CAM-SE model to an Hybrid CPU/GPU architecture. In order to help the code transformation and keep a single source code efficient on multiple architectures, we are developing a directive language as well as a tool named CLAW that allow the developer to specify and apply the necessary code transformations to generate both optimal GPU and CPU code from a single Fortran source code.

<strong>Code Generation Techniques for HPC Earth Science Applications</strong><br />
<br />
Earth Science simulations share key characteristics: There is a constant drive to higher resolutions while simultaneously incorporating ever-more sophisticated descriptions of the underlying physical processes. This trend results in a dramatic increase in the computational requirements. To support this trend, more sophisticated numerical techniques are required along with a drastic increase in computing power from emerging architectures, such as clusters of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).  Both aspects of this duality imply increased programming complexity. The difficulty does not stop there, the useful life of Earth Science applications should span several generations of hardware technology, and, moreover, new software development often extends existing legacy Fortran or C++ code. These challenges are now usually addressed by adding onto existing code: its size increases with the algorithmic complexity and new physical descriptions, parallelism is incorporated by using message-passing and/or multithreading libraries, such as MPI or pthreads, or by essentially extending the language with parallelization directives, such as OpenMP for CPUs or Intel Xeon Phi or OpenACC for GPUs. Codes targeting multiple architectures either have multiple implementations, or use extensive pre-processing macros controlled by compilation flags. The domain scientist usually has to manage multiple disciplines, including numerical analysis and high performance programming. The resulting code becomes unreadable for anyone but the developer, meaning that software maintenance is intractable. Drawing on evidence from a wide spectrum of Earth Science applications, we feel it is intuitive that new tools describing numerics and parallelism at a high level of abstraction are needed to meet these challenges of increasing complexity. This minisymposium covers a spectrum of code generation approaches. Their over-arching goal is to separate the concerns of domain science, underlying numerical techniques and high performance computing (i.e., Computer Science), so that specialists can put their expertise to best use. We consider software frameworks, such as FireDrake and FEniCS, for the high-level specification of partial differential equations, which can generate code optimized for parallel CPU and GPU clusters.  Such problem-solving frameworks are valuable for the scientist without HPC background who would like to formulate a numerical solution, which then runs optimally on a target architecture. Next, libraries for stencil calculations, such as GridTools, can help the developer isolate computation intensive kernels, which can be written in a high-level hardware-oblivious fashion making use of C++ template meta-programming. For pre-existing applications written in other languages, such as Fortran, GridTools offers an interfacing layer to take care of data management. Moreover, a Python environment is presented that can generate GridTools-compliant kernels. Source-to-source compilers, such as Omni, allow for translation of code, and can be used for domain specific extensions of existing languages, such as in the CLAW project. Finally, several use cases and numerical examples, such as the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver or the discontinuous Galerkin method, are present to illustrate the usability of these new tools.

This talk outlines strategies to advance the scalability of electronic structure algorithms intended for all-electron electronic structure theory. In the context of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, the key scalability bottleneck is the eigenvalue problem, addressed by the ELPA eigenvalue solver library and a new, broader "Electronic Structure Infrastructure" (ELSI) interface to scalable but general approaches to construct directly the density matrix with reduced prefactors and/or scaling exponents. We also address a scalable, localized resolution of identity based implementation of hybrid functionals that offers O(N) scalability for calculations of approximately 1,000 atoms system size. Finally, we show first steps towards a load-balanced CPU-GPU all-electron electronic structure implementation in the framework of the FHI-aims all-electron code.

With HPC advances of recent years, ab initio techniques are becoming the standard tool for studying and predicting many materials properties. To be effective, it is necessary to have software particularly well suited to the hardware as well as a strong interaction with the ab initio application to optimise the amount of data produced and the execution time. In this talk, I will discuss the recent developments done in ABINIT in order to pave the way towards exascale computation and the python framework we are developing to automate and optimise large workflows on HPC architectures.

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a widely used electronic structure code. The release version is parallelized using MPI and runs efficiently on current HPC hardware all over the world. The next generation of HPC hardware, however, will be quite different from the current (Xeon-like) hardware: in all probability it will consist either of GPU accelerated nodes or MIC nodes (e.g. Intel's upcoming Knights Landing processors). In my talk I'll describe the work we have been doing to get VASP ready to run efficiently on these new HPC architectures.

Since 2008, the BigDFT project consortium has developed an ab initio DFT code based on Daubechies wavelets. In recent articles, we presented the linear scaling version of BigDFT code[1], where a minimal set of localized support functions is optimised in situ for systems in various boundary conditions. We will present how the flexibility of this approach is helpful in providing a basis set that is optimally tuned to the chemical environment surrounding each atom. In addition than providing a basis useful to project Kohn-Sham orbitals informations like atomic charges and partial density of states, it can also be reused as-is, without re-optimisation, for charge-constrained DFT calculations within a fragment approach[2]. We will demonstrate the interest of this approach to express highly precise and efficient calculations of systems in complex environments[3].

<i>Co-Authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
Over the past twenty years, electronic structure calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT) have revolutionized the way in which materials are studied. Advances in computer power have clearly played a major role, but as important has been the development of new methods that (i) enhance the scale and the scope of such calculations and (ii) keep up with current trends in high-performance computing hardware. In this talk, I will outline some aspects of the development of the ONETEP [1] linear-scaling DFT code that enables accurate calculations on tens of thousands of atoms on modern architectures. Such simulations give rise to both opportunities and challenges, which I will try to highlight. I will then focus on a specific example of the application of ONETEP to a problem that is rather challenging for conventional cubic-scaling DFT due to the large system sizes involved, namely electron transport in carbon nanotube networks.

<strong>First-Principles Simulations on Modern and Novel Architectures</strong><br />
<br />
The predictive power of the so-called ab initio methods, based on the fundamental quantum-mechanical models of matter at the atomic level, together with the growing computational power of high-end High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, have led to exciting scientific and technological results in Materials Science. The increase of computational power coupled with better numerical techniques open up the possibility to simulate and predict the behaviour of larger and larger atomic systems with a higher degree of accuracy, shortening the path from theoretical results to technological applications, and opening up the possibility to design new materials from scratch. Despite the elegant simplicity of the formulation of the basic quantum mechanical principles, a practical implementation of a many-particle simulation has to use some approximations and models to be feasible. As there are several options for these approximations, different ab initio simulation codes have been developed, with different trade-offs between precision and computational effort. Each of these codes has its specific strengths and weaknesses, but all together have contributed to making computational materials science one of the domains where supercomputers raise the efficiency of producing scientific know-how and technological innovation. Indeed, a large fraction of the available workload in supercomputers around the world is spent to perform Computational Materials Science simulations. These codes have mostly kept pace with hardware improvements over the years, by relying on proven libraries and paradigms, such as MPI, that could abstract the developers from low-level considerations while the architectures evolved within a nearly homogeneous model. In the past few years, however, the emergence of heterogeneous computing elements associated with the transition from peta- to exascale has started to evidence the fragility of this model of development. The aim of the present minisymposium is to gather expert developers from different codes to discuss the challenges of porting, scaling, and optimizing material science application codes for modern and novel platforms. The presentations will focus on advanced programming paradigms, novel algorithms, domain specific libraries, in-memory data management, and software/hardware co-design. Exascale related challenges (such as sustained performance, energy awareness, code fault tolerance, task concurrency and load balancing, numerical noise and stability, big data I/O) will also be discussed.

Capsules consist of an internal medium enclosed by a semi-permeable membrane which protects it and controls its exchanges with the environment. Capsules exist in nature under the form of cells or eggs; artificial microcapsules are widely used in industry to protect active substances, aromas or flavors and control their targeted release. In most situations, capsules are suspended into another flowing liquid and are subjected to hydrodynamic forces. One robust method to model the three-dimensional fluid-structure interactions consists in coupling a boundary integral method (for the internal and external fluid motion) with a finite element method (for the membrane deformation), which we have shown to be stable and accurate. We will review how numerical models have provided insights into the dynamics of an ellipsoidal capsule in simple shear flow. We will determine which regimes are mechanically stable and correlate the results with experimental studies on artificial capsules and red blood cells.

The prediction of conversion efficiency and pollutant emissions in combustion devices is particularly challenging as they result from very complex interactions of turbulence, chemistry, and heat exchanges at very different space and time scales. In the recent years, Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) has proven to bring significant improvements in the prediction of reacting turbulent flows. The CORIA lab leads the development of the YALES2 solver, which is designed to model turbulent reactive two-phase flows with body-fitted unstructured meshes. It has been specifically tailored for dealing with very large meshes up to tens of billion cells and for solving efficiently the low-Mach number Navier-Stokes equations on massively parallel computers. The presentation will focus on the high-fidelity combustion LES and the analysis of the huge amount of data generated by these simulations. Numerical methods used to decouple the different time-scales and to optimise the mesh resolution will also be emphasized.

We discuss recent developments in the Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) methods, such as the height function method for the approximation of the geometry of the interface, the balanced-force surface tension method, and the methods that conserve mass and momentum at machine accuracy. Applications at high Reynolds number, such as high speed liquid-gas flows, and low Reynolds and low Capillary numbers, are discussed. Problems of engineering and physical interest, such as jet atomisation or flow in porous media are investigated with these methods as will be shown.

The AFiD code, an open source solver for the Navier-Stokes equations (www.afid.eu), has been ported to GPU clusters to tackle large-scale wall bounded turbulent flow simulations. The GPU port has been carried out in CUDA Fortran with the extensive use of kernel loop directives (CUF kernels) in order to have a source code as close as possible to the original CPU version. Just few routines have been manually written. On Piz-Daint (CSCS), the current GPU version can solve a 2048x3072x3072 mesh on 640 K20x GPUs in 2.4s per time step, while with 2048 GPUs, we measured 0.89s per time step. Thanks to the increased performance and efficient use of memory, this tool allows for simulations in a range parameter that is unprecedented in Rayleigh-Benard convection.

Performance prediction based on numerical simulations can be very helpful in the design process of hydraulic turbines. The Finite Volume Particle Method (FVPM) is a consistent and conservative particle-based method which inherits interesting features of both Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and grid-based Finite Volume Method. This method is particularly well-suited for such simulations thanks to its versatility. SPHEROS is a parallel FVPM solver which has been developed at the EPFL - Laboratory for Hydraulic Machines for simulating Pelton turbines and silt erosion. In order to allow the simulation of industrial-size setups, a GPU version of SPHEROS (GPU-SPHEROS) is being developed in CUDA and features Thrust library to handle complicated structures such as octree. Besides, some highly-optimised kernels are also implemented for both compute-bound and memory-bound algorithms. Comparing the performance of different parts of GPU-SPHEROS and SPHEROS, we achieve a speed-up factor of at least eight.

Large-scale computer simulations have become an indispensable tool in fluid dynamics research. Elucidating the fundamental flow physics or designing and optimizing flows for applications ranging all the way from low Reynolds number multiphase flows at small length scales to fully developed turbulence at large scales requires state-of-the art simulation capabilities. The need for large-scale HPC simulations in fluids dynamics has therefore been driving the development of novel simulation algorithms and of optimized software infrastructure. The envisioned PASC 16 symposium will bring together both developers and users of modern simulation tools. The set of talks will showcase a wide range of fields in which HPC computations are essential, highlight recent advances in computational methods and provide a platform to identify challenges and opportunities for future research.

Studying complex physical phenomena requires integrating the heterogeneous computational models of the different subsystems to analyse the interactions between the aspects that characterize the phenomenon as a whole. While efficient methods are available to build and simulate single models, the problem of devising a general approach to integrate heterogeneous models has been studied only recently and is still an open issue. We propose an engineering methodology to automate the process of integrating heterogeneous computational models. The methodology is based on the novel idea of capturing the relevant information about the different models and their integration strategies by means of meta-data that can be used to automatically generate an efficient integration framework for the specific set of models and interactions. We discuss the various aspects of the integration problem, highlight the limits of the current solutions and characterize the novel methodology by means of a concrete case study.

<strong>Abstractions for PDEs</strong>; Magne Haveraaen (University of Bergen, Norway)
<br />
<br />
<i>Co-Authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
The dominant abstraction in partial differential equations (PDEs) solvers is the array. From a computational viewpoint this makes sense: the representation theorem of PDEs ensures that any data component can be represented as an array. From a software engineering viewpoint this is not so clearcut. At the higher abstraction level, the array abstraction is not aligned with the concepts of the PDE domain. The effect is a lack of composition and reuse properties, manifest in the need to redevelop code from scratch when equations or assumptions change in unanticipated ways. At the lower level, the array abstraction is tied to a single core, uniform access memory model. The newer PGAS (partitioned global address space) model handles symmetric multicore architectures, but falls short of heterogeneous hardware (GPU, FPGA). The presentation will exemplify some of these problems, and sketch some solutions in the form of more appropriate abstractions.

<strong>A Literate Process for Improving the Quality of Scientific Computing Software</strong>; Spencer Smith (McMaster University, Canada)

<i>Co-Authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
Scientific Computing (SC) software sometimes suffers with respect to the qualities of reusability, maintainability, verifiability and reproducibility because of a lack of documentation. A potential solution is to generalize the idea of Literate Programming. Our proposed Literate Process will not only generate program documentation and code from the source files, but also other software artifacts, such as the requirements specification, design documentation, and test reports. Documentation quality will improve because a generator removes the drudgery and errors associated with information duplication and traceability. Using Haskell we have developed a prototype tool, named Drasil, to support this process. The fundamental task for Drasil is managing knowledge through what are termed chunks. A recipe is used to put the chunks together and a generator then interprets the recipes to produce the desired documentation. An example will be shown for software that simulates the temperature in a solar water heating tank.

The rapid development of novel HPC software represents a formidable challenge at the present time. Computing hardware is evolving at a faster-than-ever pace, the timely software development for these platforms requires exceptionally high productivity. Developers are often exposed to high-risks design decisions that might irreversibly compromise the software performance on the target platform. In this talk we discuss an approach that attempts to address these issues while identifying its associated costs.

<strong>Software Engineering Meets Scientific Computing: Generality, Reusability and Performance for Scientific Software Platforms I: Engineering Methodologies and Development Processes</strong><br />
<br />
Software platforms for modelling and simulation of scientific problems are becoming increasingly important in many fields and often drive the scientific discovery process. These platforms present unique requirements in terms of functionalities, performance and scalability, which limit the applicability of consolidated software engineering practices for their design, implementation and validation. For instance, since the effectiveness of a software platform for scientific simulation strictly depends on the level of performance and scalability it can achieve, the design, development and optimization of the platform are usually tailored to the specific hardware architecture the platform is expected to run on. Similarly, when a scientific simulation requires the integration of multiple software platforms, such integration is typically customized for the specific simulation problem at hand. Because of this, developing and integrating scientific computing platforms demands for a significant amount of relevant knowledge about the modeled domain and the software and hardware infrastructures used for simulation. This information typically remains hidden in the implementation details of a specific solution and cannot be easily reused to port the simulation to different hardware infrastructures or to implement or integrate different simulation platforms on the same hardware infrastructure. The Software Engineering for Scientific Computing (SESC) minisymposium is concerned with identifying suitable engineering processes to design, develop, integrate and validate software platforms for scientific modelling and simulations. This introduces challenges that require the expertise of researchers working in different areas, including computational scientists to model scientific problems, software engineers to propose engineering methodology and HPC experts to analyze platform dependent performance requirements that characterize simulations. The goal of the SESC minisymposium is to bring together software engineers, computational scientists and HPC experts to discuss and advance the engineering practices to implement platforms for scientific computing, aiming to reduce the development time, increase the reusability, the maintainability and the testability of the platforms, while offering the level of performance and scalability that is required by the simulation scenarios at hand. Specifically, the Software Engineering for Scientific Computing (SESC) minisymposium aims to address two conflicting requirements in the definition of an effective software development process: 1) promoting generality and reusability of software components, to simplify maintenance, evolution, adaptation and porting of software platforms 2) defining solution that guarantee an adequate level of performance and scalability, which is of paramount importance in scientific simulations. The SESC minisymposium is organized around two sessions: this first session focuses more specifically on design methodologies and development processes for general and reusable code; the second session (Part 2) targets the requirements of performance and scalability in scientific software platforms.

Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) frequently arise in continuum descriptions of physical processes relevant to science and engineering. Multilevel preconditioners represent a family of scalable techniques for solving discrete PDEs of this type and thus are the method of choice for highresolution simulations. The scalability and time-to-solution of massively parallel multilevel preconditioners can be adversely affected by using a coarse-level solver with sub-optimal algorithmic complexity. To maintain scalability, agglomeration techniques applied to the coarse level have been shown to be necessary. <br /><br /> In this work, we present a new software component introduced within the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation (PETSc) which permits agglomeration. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of this functionality, together with several use cases highlighting the benefits of agglomeration. Lastly, we demonstrate via numerical experiments employing geometric multigrid with structured meshes, the flexibility and performance gains possible using our MPI-rank agglomeration implementation.

Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) methods have proven to be powerful preconditioners for large and sparse linear systems arising from the &#64257;nite element discretization of elliptic PDEs. Condition number bounds can be theoretically established that are independent of the number of subdomains of the decomposition.<br /><br /> The core of the methods resides in the design of a larger and partially discontinuous &#64257;nite element space that allows for fast application of the preconditioner, where Cholesky factorizations of the subdomain &#64257;nite element problems are additively combined with a coarse, global solver. Multilevel and highly-scalable algorithms can be obtained by replacing the coarse Cholesky solver with a coarse BDDC preconditioner. <br /><br /> BDDC methods have the remarkable ability to control the condition number, since the coarse space of the preconditioner can be adaptively enriched at the cost of solving local eigenproblems. The proper identi&#64257;cation of these eigenproblems extends the robustness of the methods to any heterogeneity in the distribution of the coefficients of the PDEs, not only when the coefficients jumps align with the sub-domain boundaries or when the high contrast regions are con&#64257;ned to lie in the interior of the subdomains. The specific adaptive technique considered in this paper does not depend upon any interaction of discretization and partition; it relies purely on algebraic operations. <br /><br />Coarse space adaptation in BDDC methods has attractive algorithmic properties, since the technique enhances the concurrency and the arithmetic intensity of the preconditioning step of the sparse implicit solver with the aim of controlling the number of iterations of the Krylov method in a black-box fashion, thus reducing the number of global synchronization steps needed by the iterative solver; data movement and memory bound kernels in the
solve phase can be thus limited at the expense of extra local &#64258;ops during the setup of the preconditioner. <br /><br /> This paper presents an exposition of the BDDC algorithm that identi&#64257;es the current computational bottlenecks that could prevent it from being competitive with other solvers, and proposes solutions in anticipation of exascale architectures. Furthermore, the discussion aims to give interested practitioners sufficient insights to decide whether or not to pursue BDDC in their applications. <br /><br /> In addition, the work presents novel numerical results using the distributed memory implementation of BDDC in the PETSc library for vector &#64257;eld problems arising in the context of porous media &#64258;ows and electromagnetic modeling; the results provide evidence of the robustness of these methods for highly heterogenous problems and non-conforming discretizations.

This paper describes the Hybrid Total FETI (HTFETI) method and its parallel implementation in the ESPRESO library. HTFETI is a variant of the FETI type domain decomposition method in which a small number of neighboring subdomains is aggregated into clusters. This can be also viewed as a multilevel decomposition approach which results into a smaller coarse problem - the main scalability bottleneck of the FETI and FETI-DP methods. <br /><br />
The efficiency of our implementation which employs hybrid parallelization in the form of MPI and Cilk++ is evaluated using both weak and strong scalability tests. The weak scalability of the solver is shown on the 3 dimensional linear elasticity problem of a size up to 30 billion of Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) executed on 4096 compute nodes. The strong scalability is evaluated on the problem of size 2.6 billion DOF scaled from 1000 to 4913 compute nodes. The results show the super-linear scaling of the single iteration time and linear scalability of the solver runtime. The latter combines both numerical and parallel scalability and shows overall HTFETI solver performance. The large scale tests use our own parallel synthetics benchmark generator that is also described in the paper. <br /><br /> The last set of results shows that HTFETI is very efficient for problems of size up 1.7 billion DOF and provide better time to solution when compared to TFETI method.

We present a solver for three-dimensional compressible multicomponent flow based on the compressible Euler equations. The solver is based on a finite volume scheme for structured grids and advances the solution using an explicit Runge-Kutta time stepper. The numerical scheme requires the computation of the flux divergence based on an approximate Riemann problem. The computation of the divergence quantity is the most expensive task in the algorithm. Our implementation takes advantage of the compute capabilities of heterogeneous CPU/GPU architectures. The computational problem is organized in subdomains small enough to be placed into the GPU memory. The compute intensive stencil scheme is offloaded to the GPU accelerator while advancing the solution in time on the CPU. Our method to implement the stencil scheme on the GPU is not limited to applications in fluid dynamics. The performance of our solver was assessed on Piz Daint, a XC30 supercomputer at CSCS. The GPU code is memory-bound and achieves a per-node performance of 462 Gflop/s, outperforming by 3.2x the multicore-based Gordon Bell winning CUBISM-MPCF solver for the
offloaded computation on the same platform. The focus of this work is on the per-node performance of the heterogeneous solver. In addition, we examine the performance of the solver across 4096 compute nodes. We present simulations for the shock-induced collapse of an aligned row of air bubbles submerged in water using 4 billion cells. Results show a final pressure amplification that is 100x stronger than the strength of the initial shock.

Cardiac electrophysiology simulations are numerically extremely challenging, due to the propagation of the very steep electrochemical wave front during depolarization. Hence, in classical continuous Galerkin (CG) approaches, very small temporal and spacial discretisations are necessary to obtain physiological propagation. Until now, spatial discretisations based on discontinuous methods have received little attention for cardiac electrophysiology simulations. In particular, local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) or hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods have not been explored yet. Application of such methods, when taking advantage of their parallelity features, would allow a speed-up of the computations. In this work we provide a detailed comparison among CG, LDG and HDG methods for electrophysiology equations based on the mono-domain model. We also study the effect of the numerical integration of the non-linear ionic current term. Furthermore we plan to show the difference between classic CG methods and HDG methods on large three-dimensional simulations with patient-specific cardiac geometries.

Designing and optimising heart assist devices is complicated by a lack of parameter data and limited experimental capabilities. Thus, computational models can step in to gain a better understanding of the fluid and structure mechanics of the heart. We have developed a structural model of the heart muscle, which is coupled to a lumped parameter blood circulation. Doing this, we only focus on relevant processes for the design of heart assist devices acting on the heart's outer surface and therefore reduce computational effort. In a first step we want to show the influence of deploying force on the pericardium and to what extent the heart's contraction can be supported. In a second step force patches will be optimised toward objectives like cardiac output, contraction pattern or stress inside the heart muscle. The knowledge of how to distribute force on the heart's surface will be fundamental to the assist device design.

In this talk, we focus on the coupling of electrophysiology and mechanical models to realize an integrated model of the left ventricle by considering the active contraction of the muscle and the feedback on the electrophysiology. For the latter, we consider the mono-domain equations with the Bueno-Orovio ionic model. As for the mechanics, we consider the Holzapfl-Ogden model together with an active strain approach with a transmurally variable activation parameter. We spatially approximate the model by means of the Finite Element method and discuss the properties of different coupling strategies and time discretization schemes. Among these, we consider a fully coupled strategy with a semi-implicit scheme for the time discretization. In order to solve the linear system arising from such discretization, we use a preconditioner based on the FaCSI (Factorized Condensed SIMPLE) concept. We present and discuss numerical results obtained in the HPC framework, including patient-specific left ventricle geometries.

Coronary artery disease, caused by the build-up of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary vessel walls, is one of the leading causes of death in the world. For high-risk patients, coronary artery bypass graft is the preferred treatment. Despite overall excellent patency rates, bypasses may fail due to restenosis. In this context, we present a computational study of the fluid-dynamics in patient-specific geometries with the aim of investigating a possible relationship between coronary stenosis and graft failure. Firstly, we propose a strategy to prescribe realistic boundary conditions in absence of measured data, based on an extension of Murray's law to provide the flow division at bifurcations in case of stenotic vessels and non­-Newtonian blood rheology. Then, we show some results regarding numerical simulations in patients treated with grafts, in which the degree of coronary stenosis is virtually varied to compare the fluid-dynamics in terms of hemodynamic indices potentially involved in restenosis development.

Most oxygen in the blood circulation is carried bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs). In capillaries, the oxygen partial pressure (PO2) is affected by the individual RBCs that flow in a single file. We have developed a novel overset grid method for oxygen transport from capillaries to tissue. This approach uses moving grids for RBCs and a fixed one for the blood vessels and the tissue. This combination enables accurate modelling of the intravascular PO2 field and the unloading of oxygen from RBCs. Additionally, our model can account for fluctuations in hematocrit and hemoglobin saturation. Its parallel implementation in OpenFOAM supports three-dimensional tortuous capillary networks. Simulations of oxygen transport in the rodent cerebral cortex have been performed and are used to study the cerebral energy metabolism. Other applications include the investigation of hemoglobin saturation heterogeneity in capillary networks.

<strong>Advanced Computational Methods for Applications to the Cardiovascular System II</strong><br />
<br />
Cardiac and Cardiovascular Mathematics represents nowadays a challenging
topic in view of the emerging and growing collaborations between
clinicians and mathematicians. In this respect, the numerical solution of problems arising in modelling cardiac and systemic phenomena opens new and interesting perspectives which need to be properly addressed. From the cardiac side, a fully
integrated heart model represents a complex multiphysics problem, which
is in turn composed of several submodels describing cardiac electrophysiology, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. On the system circulation side, although it has been studied for a longer time, several mathematical and numerical aspects still need to be addressed, as e.g. tissue remodelling, atherosclerotic plaque formation, aneurysms development, transitional and turbulence phenomena in blood flows.
This minisymposium aims at gathering researchers and experts in computational and numerical modelling of the heart and the systemic circulation.

With the shift in HPC system paradigm, applications have to be re-designed to efficiently address large numbers of cores. With the advancements in network technology and communication library's, new opportunities to explore advanced programming models and load-balancing runtime system in large HPC cluster have emerged. However, it requires deep code modification that cannot be practically applied at full-scale application. We propose proto-applications as proxy for code-modernization and we will demonstrate two specialized libraries for HPC workload load-balancing based on the GASPI communication library (PGAS) and task based programming. Our first example features unstructured mesh computation using task-based parallelisation. The second demonstrates load-balancing for combustion simulation. Both proto-applications are open-source and can serve to the development of genuine HPC application.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with GASPI: We presents results both from a proxy application for CFD and its corresponding base application. We demonstrate a much improved strong scaling down to 100 mesh points per thread (on 24,000 threads) on the Intel Xeon Phi. The threading model we have used is a modified domain decomposition where reads occur across thread domains, while writes are restricted to the thread domain. We present a relaxed synchronization model for communication with a multithreaded gather and scatter of ghost cell regions. We believe that this Proxy application is representative for a much broader class of applications which make use of unstructured meshes and as such will useful to a wider community.

BPMF is a matrix factorisation technique used in recommender systems such as the ones from Netflix and Amazon. In this talk we present how to make a parallel high-performance BPMF implementation using node-level shared memory parallelism with TBB and OpenMP and distributed parallelism using GASPI and MPI. We show trade-offs and performance implications of using the different technologies and explain what works and what does not.

We present the Asynchronous Constraint Execution framework (ACE) which has been originally developed for a fully scalable single shot computation of Reverse Time Migration (RTM), the method of first choice in seismic imaging. The basic ingredients of ACE is a fine granular domain decomposition supplemented by an efficient data dependency driven task scheduling on the underlying, possibly heterogeneous compute resources. As such, it provides combined data and task parallelism. This is complemented on the interprocess level by the one-sided communication primitives of GASPI equipped with lightweight remote completion checks. This perfectly fits into the concept of data dependency driven execution and allows for perfect overlap of communication by computation. A contiguous stream of computational tasks to the underlying processing units is guaranteed. The achieved scalability with GPI2.0, the GASPI reference implementation, is almost perfect over three orders of magnitude up to 1,536 nodes (43,008 cores) as tested at LRZ SuperMUC.

<strong>Asynchronous Data-Flow Driven Programming with GASPI</strong><br />
<br />
Asynchronous data-flow driven programming with GASPI Exascale compute architectures will provide us with systems with a very large number of cores. Correspondingly we expect major challenges in the strong-scaling capabilities of the applications. Due to hardware failures and soft errors the number of cores used in a single simulation may vary. Systems are expected to be heterogeneous with respect to compute resources and they are expected to feature a heterogenous memory architecture. Machine jitter will occur at all scales with a corresponding impact on the relative application performance. Higher resolution and multiphysics simulation will require different parallelization strategies. The number of potential sources for load imbalance hence will significantly increase and the means of sharing data (access, communication, and synchronization) will have to be reconsidered on all available parallelization levels. Fortunately, with the advancements in network technology and communication libraries, new opportunities to explore advanced programming models and load-balancing runtime systems in large HPC clusters have emerged. In this minisymposium we will present applications and libraries which are based on the GASPI communication library (a PGAS API) and a task based programming model. The GASPI API increases communication performance by enabling a complete communication/computation overlap and stimulates an asynchronous, task-based programming style for better load balancing. It does this using concepts and implementation techniques that are not (yet) available in other models (e.g. MPI). This minisymposium will present four talks from different application domains, which make use of hybrid task models and the extended feature set of the GASPI API in order to deliver high scalability and a much improved robustness versus jitter. The applications domains are from Machine Learning in Life Sciences, Seismic Imaging, from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and from a work-stealing application in Combustion CFD. BPMF with GASPI: We present details about a novel implementation of a highly scalable distributed Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization, with near perfect overlap of communication and computation. BPMF is a large scale machine learning application that is able to predict (e.g., movie ratings). Here we consider the prediction of chemical compound activity on systems with millions of items. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with GASPI: We present the results from both a proxy application for CFD and its corresponding base application. We demonstrate a much improved strong scaling down to 100 mesh points per thread (on 24,000 threads) on the Intel Xeon Phi. Seismic Imaging with GASPI: Reverse time migration (RTM) is the method of first choice in seismic imaging. The achieved scalability with GASPI is almost perfect over three orders of magnitude up to 1536 nodes (43008 cores) as tested at LRZ SuperMUC. Distributed work-stealing with GASPI: We present a load-balancing library (based on work stealing) for large scale runs where we demonstrate a chemistry computation in combustion CFD simulation.

In 4D-Var, the forecast model is used to propagate the initial state to the time of the observations and is assumed to be perfect. As most aspects of the data assimilation system have improved over the years, this assumption becomes less realistic. There are theoretical benefits in using a weak-constraint formulation and a long assimilation window in 4D-Var and recent experiments have shown benefits in using overlapping assimilation windows even with strong constraint 4D-Var. The weak constraint formulation writes the optimisation problem as a function of the four dimensional state over the length of the assimilation window. In addition to its theoretical advantages, it increases the potential for parallelisation and better scalability. Using a saddle point method make it possible to take full advantage of the potential for additional parallelism. We will show how it can benefit future operational systems and reduce the time to solution in the critical path.

Météo-France has been running an operational NWP system at kilometric scale over France for the last 7 years. The aim is in particular to forecast highly precipitating events over the Mediterranean. This is the "AROME" NWP system, which is based on a 3DVar assimilating a comprehensive set of observations, including Doppler radar data and reflectivity. Yet, progress can be expected from increased use of ensembles in data assimilation, to better describe the background error statistics. A new data assimilation scheme is being developed for AROME, named EnVar, in which background error covariances are directly estimated over an ensemble and localized. The variational framework is kept in order to allow to assimilate efficiently a wide range of observations. We will show preliminary results and discuss current achievements in the numerical efficiency of the scheme with particular attention to the localization.

Scalability and performance of the variational data assimilation software NEMOVAR for the NEMO ocean model is presented. NEMOVAR is a key component of the ECMWF operational Ocean analysis System 4 (Ocean S4) and future System 5 (Ocean S5). It is designed as a four dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) algorithm, which can also support three-dimensional (3D-Var) assimilation, using the First-Guess at Appropriate Time (FGAT) approach. Central to the code performance is the implementation of the correlation operator used for modelling of the background error covariance matrix. In NEMOVAR it is achieved using a diffusion operator. A new implicit formulation of the diffusion operator has been introduced recently which solves the underlying linear system using the Chebyshev iteration. The technique is more flexible and better suited for massively parallel machines than the method currently used operationally at ECMWF, but further improvements will be necessary for the future high-resolution applications.

This study will address the numerical solution of the saddle point system arising from four dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation, including a study of preconditioning and its convergence properties. This saddle point formulation of 4D-Var allows parallelization in time dimension. Therefore, it represents a crucial step towards higher computational efficiency, since 4D-Var approaches otherwise require many sequential computations. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in saddle point problems which arise in many other applications such as constrained optimisation, computational fluid dynamics, optimal control and so forth. The key issue of solving saddle point systems with Krylov subspace methods is to find efficient preconditioners. This work focuses on the preconditioners obtained by using limited memory low-rank updates and presents numerical results obtained from the Object Oriented Prediction System (OOPS) developed by ECMWF.

<strong>Efficient Data Assimilation for Weather Forecasting on Future Supercomputer Architectures</strong><br />
<br />
Data assimilation is the process by which the initial condition for weather forecasts is determined. It combines information from a previous forecast (background) and recent observations of the Earth system, together with estimates of their respective uncertainties, to produce the best estimate of the current state of the system to be used as the initial condition for the forecast. Uncertainty around that best estimate are now also being produced. Weather forecasting models are well known for having always been at the forefront of high-performance computing (HPC). With more and more accurate data assimilation algorithms and more and more observations becoming available, the computational cost of data assimilation has become as high as that of running the forecast. However, this aspect has not been given as much attention in the HPC community. As for other applications, part of the challenge lie in the efficient use of increasingly complex supercomputer architectures. Some challenges such as increasing resolution and increasing I/O volumes are common with the forecasting problem. The fact that forecasting increasingly relies on coupled atmosphere-ocean-waves-land surface models has only just started to be really accounted for in data assimilation. It opens new perspectives as observations in one part of the system could help improve the estimation of the state in another one. However, that will increase its overall cost and complexity. Data assimilation also poses its own specific challenges, due for example to the volume and very heterogeneous distribution of observations over the globe and their very heterogeneous nature. The minisymposium aims at bringing together experts in data assimilation to expose the challenges posed by data assimilation and some of the current directions of research for addressing those, with a focus on the scalability and efficiency aspects. Among others, methods such as weak constraint 4D-Var or ensemble variational methods will be presented as they offer more parallelism in the time dimension or in exploring several directions in the space of solutions in parallel. More efficient methods for modelling background errors statistics will also be discussed.

We present path-space variational inference methods suitable for coarse-graining of complex non-equilibrium processes, typically associated with coupled physicochemical mechanisms or driven systems. Furthermore, we discuss new, scalable uncertainty quantification information methods that allow to quantify the performance of such approximate inference tools in relation to specific quantities of interest, as well as screen the parametric sensitivity of molecular systems.

We demonstrate a convolutional neural network trained to reproduce the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy of hydrocarbons from an input electron density. The output of the network is used as a nonlocal correction to conventional local and semi-local kinetic functionals. We show that this approximation qualitatively reproduces Kohn-Sham potential energy surfaces when used with conventional exchange correlation functionals. The density which minimizes the total energy given by the functional is examined in detail. We identify several avenues to improve on this exploratory work, by reducing numerical noise and changing the structure of our functional. Finally we examine the features in the density learned by the neural network to anticipate the prospects of generalizing these models.

High-throughput density functional calculations of solids are highly time-consuming. As an alternative, we propose a machine learning approach for the fast prediction of solid-state properties. To achieve this, local spin-density approximation calculations are used as a training set. We focus on predicting the value of the density of electronic states at the Fermi energy. We find that conventional representations of the input data, such as the Coulomb matrix, are not suitable for the training of learning machines in the case of periodic solids. We propose a novel crystal structure representation for which learning and competitive prediction accuracies become possible within an unrestricted class of spd systems of arbitrary unit-cell size.

Similarly to density functional calculations with a small basis set, charge equilibration schemes allow to determine charge densities which are constrained by the functional form chosen for representing this charge density. The flow of the charge is determined by the electrostatic interactions and the local electronegativity of all the atoms. By introducing an atomic environment dependent electronegativity, which is predicted by a neural network, we can reach density functional accuracy at a small fraction of the numerical cost of a full density functional calculation for ionic materials. Extension to other materials will also be discussed.

<strong>From Materials' Data to Materials' Insight by Machine Learning</strong><br />
<br />
The rise of high-throughput computational materials design promises to revolutionize the process of discovery of new materials, and tailoring of their properties. At the same time, by generating the structures of hundreds of thousands of hypothetical compounds, the issue of automated processing of large amounts of materials' data has been made very urgent - to identify structure-property relations, rationalize intuitively the behaviour of materials of increasing complexity, and re-use existing information to accelerate the prediction of properties and accelerate the search of materials' space. To address this challenge, a strongly interdisciplinary effort has developed, uniting forces among researchers in applied mathematics, computer science, chemistry and materials science, that aims at adapting machine-learning techniques to the specific problems that are encountered when working with materials. This minisymposium will showcase the most recent developments in this field, and provide a forum for some of the leading figures to discuss the most pressing challenges and the most promising directions. The participants will be selected to represent the many disciplines that are contributing to this endeavour and will cover the following topics: the representation of materials' structures and properties in a synthetic form that is best suited for automated processing, learning of the structure-property relations and circumventing the large computational cost of high-end electronic structure calculations, the identification of outliers and the automatic assessment of the reliability of input data, demonstrative applications to important materials science problems.

<strong>Asymptotically Stable Particle-in-Cell Methods for the Vlasov-Poisson System with a Strong External Magnetic Field</strong>; Francis Filbet (University of Toulouse, France)
<br />
<br />
<i>Co-Authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
This work deals with the numerical resolution of the Vlasov-Poisson system with a strong external magnetic field by Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods. In this regime, classical PIC methods are subject to stability constraints on the time and space steps related to the small Larmor radius and plasma frequency. Here, we propose an asymptotic-preserving PIC scheme which is not subjected to these limitations. Our approach is based on first and higher order semi-implicit numerical schemes already validated on dissipative systems. Additionally, when the magnitude of the external magnetic field becomes large, this method provides a consistent PIC discretization of the guiding-center equation, that is, incompressible Euler equation in vorticity form. We propose several numerical experiments which provide a solid validation of the method and its underlying concepts.

iPIC3D is a massively parallel three-dimensional implicit particle-in-cell code used for the study of the interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. Because the scalability potential and scientific impact demonstrated by iPIC3D, it has been selected in many European HPC projects to prepare for the future exascale machines. In this talk, we present new algorithmic changes to iPIC3D in preparation for the coming exascale era. In particular, we will present decoupled computation, communication and I/O operations in iPIC3D to address the challenges of irregular operations on large number of processes. Our evaluation results show that the performance benefits from this model increases as the scale of simulation increases. We also present a two-way coupled kinetic-fluid model with multiple implicit PIC domains (by the iPIC3D code) embedded in MHD (by the BATS-R-US code) under the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF).

Particle methods are very popular for the discretization of kinetic equations, since they are embarrassingly parallel. In plasma physics the high dimensionality (6D) of the problems raises the costs of grid based codes, favouring the mesh free transport with particles. A standard Particle in Cell (PIC) scheme couples the particle density to a grid based field solver using finite elements. In this particle mesh coupling the stochastic error appears as noise, while the deterministic error leads to e.g. aliasing, inducing unphysical instabilities. Projecting the particles onto a spectral grid yields an energy and momentum conserving, almost sure aliasing free scheme, Particle in Fourier (PIF). For few electrostatic modes PIF has very little computational overhead, rendering it suitable for a fast implementation. We present 6D Vlasov-Poisson simulations of Landau damping and a Bump-on-Tail instability and compare the results as well as the computational performance to a grid based semi-Lagrangian solver.

<br />
Simulating the full six-dimensional phase-space Vlasov equations represents a challenge due to the Curse of Dimensionality. In the struggle to reduce the number of degrees of freedom needed in the Eulerian simulations, several adaptive methods were developed. Adaptive Mesh Refinement technics allow to dynamically adapt the grid in an isotropic way. Both Block-Structured [Hittinger, Collela] and Fully-Threaded Tree [Khoklov, Zanoti, Dumbser] implementations succeed in lower-than-three-dimensional kinetic simulations. For higher dimensionality, the authors of adaptive methods tend to favour tensor product structures such as the Tree-of-Tree method [Kolobov], the Sparse Grids [Griebel, Bungartz] or the Tensor-Train method [Oseledets, Kormann]. We propose to discuss and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks.

Grid-based solvers for the Vlasov equation give accurate results but suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To enable the grid-based solution of the Vlasov equation in 6d phase-space, we need efficient parallelization schemes. In this talk, we consider the 6d Vlasov-Poisson problem discretized by a split-step semi-Lagrangian scheme. This method works with successive 1d interpolations on 1d stripes of the 6d domain. We consider two parallelization strategies: A remapping strategy that works with two different layouts keeping parts of the dimensions sequential and a classical partitioning into hyper-rectangles. The 1d interpolations can be performed sequentially on each processor for the remapping scheme. On the other hand, the remapping consists in an all-to-all communication pattern. The partitioning only requires localized communication but each 1d interpolation needs to be performed on distributed data. We compare both parallelization schemes and discuss how to efficiently handle the domain boundaries in the interpolation for partitioning.

We study the dynamics of charged particles under the influence of a strong magnetic field by numerically solving the Vlasov-Poisson and guiding center models. We implement an efficient (from the memory access point of view) particle-in-cell method which enables simulations with a large number of particles. We present numerical results for classical Landau damping and Kelvin-Helmholtz test cases. The implementation also relies on a standard hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization. Code performance is assessed by the observed speedup and attained memory bandwidth.

<strong>HPC Implementations and Numerics for Kinetic Plasma Models</strong><br />
<br />
The fundamental model in plasma physics is a kinetic description by a phase-space distribution function solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equation. Due to the complexity of the models, computer simulations are of key importance in understanding the behaviour of plasmas e.g. in fusion reactors and a wide range of codes exists in the plasma physics community and are run on large-scale computing facilities. However, kinetic simulations are very challenging due to the relatively high-dimensionality, the presence of multiple scales, and turbulences. For this reason, state-of-the-art plasma solvers mostly discretize simplified models like the gyrokinetic equations. Recent advances in computing power render it possible to approach the full six-dimensional system. The focus of the minisymposium is to bring together researchers developing modern numerical methods and optimized implementation of scalable algorithms for a future generation of plasma codes capable of simulating new physical aspects. Two types of methods are used in state-of-the-art Vlasov solvers: particle-based and grid-based methods. Especially for high-dimensional models, particle-based methods are many times preferred due to a better scaling with dimensionality. Even though particle-in-cell codes are embarrassingly parallel, care has to be taken in the layout of the memory structure in order to enable fast memory access on high-performance computers. On the other hand, grid-based methods are known to give accurate results for reduced Vlasov equations in two and four dimensional phase space. Domain partitioning strategies and scalable interpolation algorithms for semi-Lagrangian methods need to be developed. Mesh refinement can also be used to reduce the number of grid points. Macro-scale properties of the plasma can often be described by a fluid model. Spectral discretization methods have the attractive feature that they reduce the kinetic model to a number of moments - thus incorporating a fluid description of plasmas. A central aspect of this minisymposium will be the simulation of highly magnetized plasmas. This is the situation for fusion devices based on magnetic confinement fusion, like the ITER project. In this configuration, the particle exhibit a fast circular motion around the magnetic field lines, the so-called gyromotion. This motion gives rise to multiple scales since turbulences arise on a much slower time scale. Asymptotically preserving schemes can tackle the time scale of the gyromotion beyond the gyrokinetic model.

During last decades, computational scientists have experienced a sustained and continuous increase in models complexity. Current models are not only more detailed and accurate but also span across multiple scales and scientific domains. Instead of writing complicated and monolithic models ex novo, we have explored the coupling of existing single-scale and single-science applications in order to produce multi-scale and multi-science models. We have proposed a theoretical formalism which allows to describe how submodels are coupled (Multiscale Modeling Language - MML), as well as a coupling library (MUSCLE) which allows to build arbitrary workflow from the submodels. Currently, we are exploring the execution of such model across several computing resources, in order to increase available CPU power. In order to properly deploy an execution across several clusters we have developed a discrete event simulator able to predict the relevance of a given an allocation scheme.

Quantum-ESPRESSO builds upon electronic-structure codes that have been developed by some of the original authors of electronic-structure algorithms and is used by leading materials modelling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures. Quantum-ESPRESSO has thousands of active users world-wide representing a large fraction of the workload of many HPC centers, it is widely used for benchmarking and co-design. The need to keep the pace with the evolution of the HPC architectures without disrupting the possibility to improve the algorithms and the physics implemented, together with the request of maintain a compatibility with low-end systems, regardless the hardware, the OS and the user interface, represent a real challenge, being a community effort of voluntary developers. In the talk the development strategy, the human network aspects and the technological challenges involved in this community effort, will be presented and discussed.

This contribution describes an instance of the practitioner approach to application tuning for HPC deploy, starting on a small-size server and applying a black-box approach to performance tuning. The bio-medical iCardioCloud project aims at establishing a computational framework to perform a complete patient-specific numerical analysis specially oriented to aortic diseases. The application is based on CFD. The work here reported shows the SE basic approach to tuning within a black-box approach: optimisation of the build process, analysis of module dependencies, assessment of possible compiler-based optimisations, final targeting on a specific architecture, generation of various scripts for optimised builds. The experience gained with this study case shows to which extent a skilled IT professional is actually required in a domain specific application to move the process from a naive to an advanced solution.

One of the major challenges in mass-spec driven proteomics research is data-analysis. Many research facilities have the capacity to generate several gigabytes of data per hour. To process such data though, software solutions for high-throughput data analysis often require a cluster computing infrastructure. Since many research facilities do not have the required IT infrastructure for large-scale data-processing, this kind of proteomics research was restricted to only a few proteomics groups. Here we present a software solution that is capable of processing terabytes of large proteomics experiments on a cheap desktop gaming PC setup. We will focus on how to overcome the issue of limited resources while still maintaining a high-throughput data-analysis and reasonable scalability.

<strong>Software Engineering Meets Scientific Computing: Generality, Reusability and Performance for Scientific Software Platforms II: Performance and Scalability Requirements</strong><br />
<br />
Software platforms for modelling and simulation of scientific problems are becoming increasingly important in many fields and often drive the scientific discovery process. These platforms present unique requirements in terms of functionalities, performance and scalability, which limit the applicability of consolidated software engineering practices for their design, implementation and validation. For instance, since the effectiveness of a software platform for scientific simulation strictly depends on the level of performance and scalability it can achieve, the design, development and optimization of the platform are usually tailored to the specific hardware architecture the platform is expected to run on. Similarly, when a scientific simulation requires the integration of multiple software platforms, such integration is typically customized for the specific simulation problem at hand. Because of this, developing and integrating scientific computing platforms demands for a significant amount of relevant knowledge about the modeled domain and the software and hardware infrastructures used for simulation. This information typically remains hidden in the implementation details of a specific solution and cannot be easily reused to port the simulation to different hardware infrastructures or to implement or integrate different simulation platforms on the same hardware infrastructure. The Software Engineering for Scientific Computing (SESC) symposium is concerned with identifying suitable engineering processes to design, develop, integrate and validate software platforms for scientific modelling and simulations. This introduces challenges that require the expertise of researchers working in different areas, including computational scientists to model scientific problems, software engineers to propose engineering methodology and HPC experts to analyze platform dependent performance requirements that characterize simulations. The goal of the SESC minisymposium is to bring together software engineers, computational scientists and HPC experts to discuss and advance the engineering practices to implement platforms for scientific computing, aiming to reduce the development time, increase the reusability, the maintainability and the testability of the platforms, while offering the level of performance and scalability that is required by the simulation scenarios at hand. Specifically, the Software Engineering for Scientific Computing (SESC) minisymposium aims to address two conflicting requirements in the definition of an effective software development process: 1) promoting generality and reusability of software components, to simplify maintenance, evolution, adaptation and porting of software platforms 2) defining solution that guarantee an adequate level of performance and scalability, which is of paramount importance in scientific simulations. The SESC minisymposium is organized around two sessions: this session targets the requirements of performance and scalability in scientific software platforms; the other session (Part 1) focuses more specifically on design methodologies and development processes for general and reusable code.

<p><strong>Big Data Visual Analysis</strong>; Chris Johnson (University of Utah, USA)</p>
<h3><strong><br /></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>We live in an era in which the creation of new data is growing exponentially such that every two days we create as much new data as we did from the beginning of mankind until the year 2003. One of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st century is to effectively understand and make use of the vast amount of information being produced. Visual data analysis will be among our most important tools to understand such large and often complex data. In this talk, I will present state-of-the-art visualization techniques, applied to important Big Data problems in science, engineering, and medicine.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges for Climate and Weather Prediction in the Era of Heterogeneous Computer Architectures: Oscillatory Stiffness, Time-Parallelism, and the Slow Manifold</strong>; Beth Wingate (University of Exeter, UK)</p>
<h3><strong><br /></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>For weather or climate models to achieve exascale performance on next-generation heterogeneous computer architectures they will be required to exploit on the order of million- or billion-way parallelism. This degree of parallelism far exceeds anything possible in today's models even though they are highly optimized. In this talk I will discuss the mathematical issue that leads to the limitations in space- and time-parallelism for climate and weather prediction models - oscillatory stiffness in the PDE. I will go on to discuss recent successful time-parallel algorithms including the fast-converging asymptotic parareal method and a time-parallel matrix exponential.</p>

We present a high performance comprehensive implementation of a multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) simulation on multicore architectures with hardware accelerators in the context of computational astronomy. This implementation will be used as an operational testbed for simulating the design of new instruments for the European Extremely Large Telescope project (E-ELT), the world's biggest eye and one of Europe's highest priorities in ground-based astronomy. The simulation corresponds to a multi-step multi-stage procedure, which is fed, near real-time, by system and turbulence data coming from the telescope environment. Based on the PLASMA library powered by the OmpSs dynamic runtime system, our implementation relies on a task-based programming model to permit an asynchronous out-of-order execution. Using modern multicore architectures associated with the enormous computing power of GPUs,
the resulting data-driven compute-intensive simulation of the entire MOAO application, composed of the tomographic reconstructor and the observing sequence, is capable of coping
with the aforementioned real-time challenge and stands as a reference implementation for the computational astronomy community.

This article describes how we manage to increase performance and to extend features of a large parallel application through the use of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) and by designing a robust parallel transpose algorithm. The semi-Lagrangian code Gysela typically performs large physics simulations using a few thousands of cores, between 1k cores up to 16k on x86-based clusters. However, simulations with finer resolutions and with kinetic electrons increase those needs by a huge factor, providing a good example of applications requiring Exascale machines. To improve Gysela compute times, we take advantage of efficient SMT implementations available on recent INTEL architectures. We also analyze the cost of a transposition communication scheme that involves a large number of cores in our case. Adaptation of the code for balance load whenever using both SMT and good deployment strategy led to a significant reduction that can be up to 38% of the execution times.

We present a high-performance framework for single- and multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo methods applicable to a large class of problems in uncertainty quantification. A typical application of interest is the approximation of expectations of quantities depending on solutions to e.g. partial differential equations with uncertain inputs, often yielding integrals over high-dimensional spaces. The goal of the software presented in this paper is to allow recently developed quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods with high, dimension-independent orders of convergence to be combined with a multilevel approach and applied to large problems in a generic way, easing distributed memory parallel implementation. The well-known multilevel Monte Carlo method is also supported as a particular case, and some standard choices of distributions are included. For so-called <em>interlaced polynomial lattice rules</em>, a recently developed QMC method, precomputed generating vectors are required; some such vectors are provided for common cases.<br /><br /> After a theoretical introduction, the implementation is briefly explained and a user guide is given to aid in applying the framework to a concrete problem. We give two examples: a simple model problem designed to illustrate the mathematical concepts as well as the advantages of the multilevel method, including a measured decrease in computational work of multiple orders of magnitude for engineering accuracy, and a larger problem that exploits high-performance computing to show excellent parallel scaling. Some concrete use cases and applications are mentioned, including uncertainty quantification of partial differential equation models, and the approximation of solutions of corresponding Bayesian inverse problems. This software framework easily admits modifications; custom features like schedulers and load balancers can be implemented without hassle, and the code documentation includes relevant details.

The increasing complexity of the software/hardware stack of modern supercomputers makes understanding the performance of the modern massive-scale codes difficult. Distributed graph algorithms (DGAs) are at the forefront of that complexity, pushing the envelope with their massive irregularity and data dependency. We analyse the existing body of research on DGAs to assess how technical contributions are linked to experimental performance results in the field. We distinguish <em>algorithm-level</em> contributions related to graph problems from "runtime-level" concerns related to communication, scheduling, and other low-level features necessary to make distributed algorithms work. We show that the runtime is an integral part of DGAs' experimental results, but it is often ignored by the authors in favor of algorithm-level contributions. We argue that a DGA can only be fully understood as a combination of these two aspects and that detailed reporting of runtime details must become an integral part of scientific standard in the field if results are to be truly understandable and interpretable. Based on our analysis of the field, we provide a template for reporting the runtime details of DGA results, and we further motivate the importance of these details by discussing in detail how seemingly minor runtime changes can make or break a DGA.

Signal transduction across cellular membranes is controlled by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is widely accepted that members of the GPCR family self-assemble as dimers or higher-order structures being functional units in the plasma membrane. The chemokines receptors are GPCRs implicated in a wide range of physiological and non-physiological cell processes. These receptors represent prime targets for therapeutic intervention in a wide spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, cancer and HIV. The CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors are two of the manly studied playing crucial roles in different pathologies. In this scenario the use of computational techniques able to describe complex biological processes such as protein dimerization acquires a great importance. Combining coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics (MetaD) we are able to describe the mechanism of dimer formation, capturing multiple association and dissociation events allowing to compute a detailed free energy landscape of the process.

Individual fish swimming in a school encounter vortices generated by the propulsion of upstream members. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that these hydrodynamic interactions may increase thrust without additional energy expenditure. However, difficulties associated with experimental studies have prevented a systematic quantification of this phenomenon. Using simulations of self-propelled swimmers, we investigate some of the mechanisms by which fish may exploit each others' wake to reduce energy expenditure. We quantify the relative importance of two mechanisms for increasing swimming efficiency: the decrease in relative velocity induced by proximity to wake vortices; and wall/"channelling" effects. Additionally, we conduct simulations of fish swimming in the Karman vortex street behind a static cylinder. This configuration helps us clarify the role of the bow pressure wave, entrainment, and "vortex-surfing" in enhancing propulsive efficiency of trout swimming near obstacles.

Ion-Cyclotron Range of Frequency (ICRF) waves is an efficient source of plasma heating in tokamaks and stellarators. In ICRF heated plasmas, the resonating particles phase-space distribution function displays significant distortion. A significant consequence is to modify noticeably the plasma properties which dictates the propagation of the ICRF wave. The self-consistent modelling tool SCENIC was built in order to solve this highly non-linear problem. It is one of the few ICRF modelling tools able to tackle both 2D and 3D plasma configurations. The computational resources, in particular the amount of shared memory required to resolve the plasma equilibrium and the wave propagation, significantly increases for simulations of strongly 3D equilibrium such as stellarators compared to 2D tokamaks calculation. We present some applications of SCENIC to tokamak and stellarator plasmas. Particular focus is given to simulations of the recenlty started Wendelstein7-X stellarator experiment which will use ICRF waves for fast particle generation.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is extensively used for modelling of blood flow in intracranial aneurysms as it can help clinicians in decision for intervention, and may potentially provide information on the pathogenesis of the condition. The flow regime in aneurysms, due to low Reynolds number is mostly presumed laminar - an assumption that was challenged in recent publications that showed high frequency fluctuations in aneurysms resembling transitional flow. The present work aspires to scrutinize the issue of transition in aneurysmal hemodynamics by performing first true direct numerical simulations on aneurysms of various morphologies, with resolutions of the order of Kolmogorov scales, resulting in 1 billion cells. The results show the onset of fluctuations in flow inside aneurysm during deceleration phase of the cardiac cycle before a re-laminarization during acceleration. The fluctuations confine in the aneurysm dome suggesting the manifestation of aneurysm as an initiator of transition to turbulence.

Due to the massive penetration of alternative renewable energies, hydraulic power plants are key energy conversion technologies to stabilize the electrical power network using hydraulic machines at off design operating conditions. For a flow rate larger than the one at the best efficient point a cavitating vortex rope occurs, leading to strong pressure surges in the entire hydraulic system. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the pressure surges, URANS simulations of a reduced scale Francis turbine are performed. Several sigma values are investigated corresponding to stable and unstable cavitating vortex ropes. The results are compared with the experimental measurements. The main challenge of the computations is the long physical time, compared to the time step, required to capture the beginning of the instability.

Parallel-in-time integration techniques have been hailed as a potential paths to exascale for the solution of evolution type problems. Methods of time-parallel integration are intended to extend parallel scaling on compute clusters beyond what is possible using conventional domain decomposition techniques alone. In this talk we give a short introduction to space-time parallelism with emphasis on the parareal method. We then proceed to present resent advances in the construction of the coarse operator needed in the iterative correction scheme. The modifications allow for parallel-in-time acceleration of purely hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations, something previously widely considered impractical. The talk is concluded with a presentation of preliminary results on parallel-in-time integration of a two-dimensional shallow-water-wave equation that governs the underlying dynamics in a tsunami simulation application.

PERMON forms a collection of software libraries, uniquely combining quadratic programming (QP) algorithms and domain decomposition methods (DDM), built on top of the well-known PETSc framework for numerical computations. Among the main applications are contact problems of mechanics. Our PermonFLLOP package is focused on non-overlapping DDM of the FETI type, allowing efficient and robust utilization of contemporary parallel computers for problems with billions of unknowns. Any FEM software can be used to generate mesh and assemble the stiffness matrices and load vectors per each subdomain independently. Additionally, a mapping from the local to the global numbering of degrees of freedom is needed, and non-penetration and friction information in case of contact problems. All these data are passed to PermonFLLOP, which prepares auxiliary data needed in the DDM. PermonQP is then called in the backend to solve the resulting equality constrained problem with additional inequality constraints in case of contact problems.

DBCSR is the sparse matrix library at the heart of the CP2K linear scaling electronic structure theory algorithm. It is MPI and OpenMP parallel, and can exploit accelerators. The multiplication algorithm is based on Cannon's algorithm, whose scalability is limited by the MPI communication time. The implementation is based on MPI point-to-point communications. We present an improved implementation that takes in account the sparsity of the problem in order to reduce the communication. This implementation makes use of one-sided communications. Performance results for representative CP2K benchmarks will be also presented.

The presentation deals with the energy consumption evaluation of the FETI method blending iterative and direct solvers in the scope of READEX project. The measured characteristics on model cube benchmark illustrate the behaviour of preprocessing and solve phases related mainly to the CPU frequency, different problem decompositions, compiler's type and compiler's parameters. In preprocessing it is necessary to factorize the stiffness and coarse problem matrices, which belongs to the most time and also energy consuming operations. The solve employs the conjugate gradient algorithm and consists of sparse matrix-vector multiplications and vector dot products or AXPY functions. In each iteration we need to apply direct solver twice for pseudo-inverse action and coarse problem solution. All these operations cover together the basic Sparse and Dense BLAS Level 1, 2 and 3 routines, so that we can explore their different dynamism and dynamic switching between various configurations can then provide significant energy savings.

<i>Co-authors: Philipp Grohs (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Ralf Hiptmair (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
The Boltzmann equation provides a fundamental mesoscopic model for the dynamics of rarefied gases. The computational challenge arising from it's discretization is twofold: we face a moderately high-dimensional problem and the collision operator is non-linear and non-local in the velocity variable. We aim for a deterministic and asymptotically exact Galerkin discretization. This sets our approach apart from stochastic Monte-Carlo-type and Fourier based methods. We consider a tensor product discretization of the distribution function combining Laguerre polynomials times a Maxwellian in velocity with continuous first-order finite elements in space. Unlike the Fourier spectral methods, our approach does not require truncation of the velocity domain and it does not suffer from aliasing errors. The advection problem is discretized through a Galerkin least-squares technique and yields an implicit formulation in time. Numerical results of benchmark simulations in 2+2 dimensions will be presented.

Numerical weather prediction and climate models like COSMO and ICON solve explicitly a large set of PDEs. The STELLA library was successfully used to port the dynamical core of COSMO providing a performance portable code across multiple platforms. A significant performance speedup was obtained for NVIDIA GPUs as reported in doi>10.1145/2807591.2807676. However its applicability was restricted to only cartesian structured grids, finite difference methods, and is difficult to be used outside the COSMO model. The GridTools project emerges as an effort to provide an ecosystem for developing portable and efficient grid applications for the explicit solution of PDEs. GridTools generalizes STELLA to a wider class of weather and climate models on multiple grids: Cartesian and spherical, and offers facilities for performing communication and setting boundary conditions. Here we present the GridTools API and show performance on NVIDIA GPUs and x86 platforms.

The solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is needed in many applications in computational science and engineering. For an important class of PDEs multigrid methods are optimal solvers, nevertheless the choice of the right components can be difficult, especially in a parallel environment, as is the parallel implementation on up-to-date supercomputers with millions of cores, accelerators etc. Within the project ExaStencils we work on the automatic generation of multigrid methods to achieve higher productivity as well as performance portability through the automatic choice of different components of multigrid methods and the associated parameters optimised for a given hardware architecture. The core of ExaStencils is a hierarchy of domain specific languages that provide different levels of abstraction. The languages address the needs of application scientists, mathematicians, and computer scientists and allow for different optimisations. In this talk an overview over the current state of the project will be provided.

<br />
In the German Research Foundation project ESSEX (Equipping Sparse Solvers for Exascale), we develop scalable sparse eigensolver libraries for large quantum physics problems. Partners in ESSEX are the Universities of Erlangen, Greifswald, Wuppertal, Tokyo and Tsukuba as well as DLR. The project pursues a coherent co-design of all software layers where a holistic performance engineering process guides code development across the classic boundaries of application, numerical method and basic kernel library. Within ESSEX the numerical methods cover widely applicable solvers such as classic Krylov, Jacobi-Davidson or recent FEAST methods and domain specific iterative schemes relevant for the ESSEX quantum physics applications. Using the ESSEX software framework, we present recent work on sparse eigenvalue solvers for heterogeneous computing systems with a focus on the difficult problem of finding interior eigenvalues. In this context, we also discuss the application of the CARP-CG method as a preconditioner for applications such as Graphene simulation.

The Fast Multipole Method is a generic toolbox algorithm for many important scientific applications, e.g. molecular dynamics. It enables us to compute all long-range O(N^2) pairwise interactions for N particles in O(N) for any given precision. Unfortunately, the runtime of such simulations is already communication bound. To increase the performance on modern HPC hardware, a more sophisticated parallelization scheme is required. Especially the reduction of MPI collectives is a vital issue to increase the strong scaling. In this talk we will focus exclusively on the internode communication via MPI. We will present a latency-avoiding communication scheme and its implementation for our C++11 FMM toolbox. The implementation consists of several layers of abstraction to hide/encapsulate low level MPI calls and specifics of the communication algorithm. We will also show examples of the scaling capabilities of the FMM on a BG/Q for small and medium size MD problems.

Future exascale systems are expected to have a mean time between failure in the range of minutes. Classical approaches such as checkpointing and then recomputing the missing solution will be therefore out of scope. Algorithm-based fault tolerance in contrast aims to continue without recomputations and with only minor extra computational effort. Therefore, numerical schemes have to be adapted. We present algorithm-based fault tolerance for the solution of high-dimensional PDEs. They exploit a hierarchical extrapolation scheme, the sparse grid combination technique. Using the hierarchical ansatz, we show how hard faults can be mitigated without checkpoint-restart. Furthermore we explain how even soft faults (for example due to silent data corruption) can often be detected and handled.

<strong>Development, Adaption, and Implementation of Numerical Methods for Exascale</strong><br />
<br />
Nowadays supercomputers with millions of cores, specialized communication networks and in many cases accelerators pose big challenges for the development of scientific applications. In most cases, the efficiency of these applications largely dominated by one or a few numerical methods. As a consequence these underlying methods have to be able to use the available machine efficiently. The Priority Programme 1648 SPPEXA funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) aims at tackling software challenges that arise on the way to exascale. One important part of these challenges are extremely scalable methods. SPPEXA's first year of its second three-year funding period started in January. In this minisymposium a subset of the project specifically addressing the challenges in numerical methods will present their approaches towards exascale numerics. The topics include fault tolerance, latency avoiding and automatic code generation, as well as strategies to achieve the extreme scalability that will be needed in the future.

Turbulence is the most common state of fluid motion in nature and engineering and is critical in environmental, astrophysical and engineering flows. However, the complexity of the governing equations leads to wide ranges of temporal and spatial scales and render the problem almost intractable analytically. Thus, simulations, in particular direct numerical simulations (DNS) which resolve the entire range of scales from the exact governing equations, have become an indispensable tool to advance the field. While very accurate spectral methods have been used extensively up to petascale levels, they typically require collective communications and synchronizations, two well-known potential bottlenecks at exascale. We present our recent work on novel asynchronous numerical schemes that virtually remove computational obstacles at a mathematical level and present a path towards exascale DNS of turbulent flows. We will highlight implications, challenges and opportunities in terms of numerical issues, parallel performance, and implementation issues on future exascale systems.

Electrochemical interfaces are host to a range of physical phenomena involving ion-transport, electrostatics and fluid flow. In this presentation, we consider voltage-driven ion transport from an aqueous electrolyte to an ion-selective membrane as a canonical setting with broad applications in electrochemistry. We will present results from our numerical simulations demonstrating that, beyond a threshold voltage, such interfaces trigger hydrodynamic chaos with multi-scale vortices despite their low Reynolds number. Namely, structures with scales from sub-millimeter down to tens of nanometers can be formed as a natural result of these hydrodynamic instabilities. These flow structures are shown to impact mixing and enhance system-level transport well beyond nominal diffusion-controlled processes. We will demonstrate the need for the development of specialized algorithms for computation of these systems, similar to the tools that have been traditionally used for the simulations of turbulent flows. Such calculations require massively parallel computational resources beyond what is available today.

Methods for the (MPI-based) parallel numerical solution of free-surface flow problems using an ALE-based finite-element method will be presented. The deforming fluid domain is treated as a pseudo-elastic solid for small deformations, but can also be completely remeshed to handle extreme changes. Techniques for the continuation of solution branches in the presence of remeshing will be described and used to demonstrate the existence of new solutions for the canonical problems of viscous fluid flow on the outside or inside of rotating cylinders, and to quantify the accuracy of thin-film approximations. The same techniques will also be used to characterise the solution structure that develops for two-phase flow in partially-occluded Hele-Shaw cells. That system becomes more sensitive as the aspect ratio is increased in the sense that multiple solutions are provoked for smaller occlusions, which is conjectured to underlie the experimentally observed sensitivity of such cells at large aspect ratios.

SPH-Flow is a multi-purpose, multi-physics CFD software based on the SPH method (smoothed particle hydrodynamics). It is developed by Ecole Centrale Nantes and Nextflow Software. The solver was first developed for fluid flow simulations dedicated to complex non-linear free surface problems and has then been extended to multi-fluid, multi-structure, fluid/structure interaction and viscous flows. It relies on state of the art meshless algorithms. SPH-Flow solver is parallelized with a distributed memory parallelization relying on a domain decomposition. Today, the applicative computations usually performed involve 64 to 4000 processors, depending on the problem. New industrial problems can now be solved with this method and its efficient HPC implementation. This talk will address the description of the SPH-Flow solver and parallelization. Massively parallel complex innovative simulations will then be discussed: Tire aquaplaning simulations, Wave impacts on a ship, Fluid flow in a car gear box and River-crossing simulations of a car.

<br />
A new high order, high resolution hybrid MPI-CUDA code for the simulation of turbulent channel flow on many distributed GPUs is presented. The code benefits from the use of powerful and efficient heterogeneous architectures with GPUs accelerators. Optimization strategies involving the joint use of GPU and CPU lead to excellent performance. Asynchronous GPU-CPU execution achieves almost complete overlap of computations, memory transfer from/to device/host and MPI communications. A considerable speedup is gained with respect to similar synchronous codes. Test cases and performance results show the code is suitable for the next generation of large direct numerical simulations of turbulence.

<strong>High-Performance Computing in Fluid Mechanics II</strong><br />

Large-scale computer simulations have become an indispensable tool in fluid dynamics research. Elucidating the fundamental flow physics or designing and optimizing flows for applications ranging all the way from low Reynolds number multiphase flows at small length scales to fully developed turbulence at large scales requires state-of-the art simulation capabilities. The need for large-scale HPC simulations in fluids dynamics has therefore been driving the development of novel simulation algorithms and of optimized software infrastructure. The envisioned PASC 16 symposium will bring together both developers and users of modern simulation tools. The set of talks will showcase a wide range of fields in which HPC computations are essential, highlight recent advances in computational methods and provide a platform to identify challenges and opportunities for future research.

Big Data is introducing a number of inescapable trends. Firstly, we are creating data at an exponential rate. Second, we need to use complicated algorithms to unlock the potential of the data. This combination results into the realisation that Big Data workloads are fast crossing into the realm of HPC. Challenges, that include how to merge the Big Data and HPC computing paradigms, how to virtualise HPC so as the serve the vast numbers of Big Data programmers and users and how to keep up with performance expectations in a post Moore's law landscape are clearly hot topics. We will discuss these issues and give a glimpse of what we think are ways forward.

Future physics experiments and observatories rely on the capabilities to process significantly larger data streams. Examples are future light-source experiments, elementary particle experiments and radio-astronomy observatories. All have in common that they plan to exploit high-performance compute capabilities instead of relying on hardware controlled data processing. This approach increases flexibility during the lifetime of such experiments and may increase the use of commodity hardware, which is typically cheaper compared to custom solutions. While these experiments can thus benefit from HPC architectures and technologies, both as being available today as well as planned on future roadmaps, the requirements and use models differ significantly from today's high-performance computing. In this talk we will analyse the requirements of a few examples and discuss how they will benefit from current as well as future HPC technologies.

Operating large computing systems reliably and efficiently requires to implement fine grain monitoring and tuning policies in order to contain operational costs while increasing reliability. Data collected during operations, to be used on the fly, or to be analysed offline represent a wealth of information to be exploited. One particularly interesting area is near real-time predictive analysis that would enable to swiftly take corrective action in case of excursions or impending component failures, with minimal interruptions of service. Moving and integrating data originating from heterogeneous sources however presents several challenges in the development of solutions to automate the process. The majority of data sets originates from specialized storage systems, log files, environmental data and relational databases. With hierarchical data analysis and enough data monitoring at hand, predictive fault models based on machine learning can be developed at scale.

Supercomputers are typically used in a batch oriented fashion: simulations are launched via queuing system, intermediate results stored on a global file system and the final results are obtained via post-processing on a separate visualization system. The amount of data generated by large-scale simulations and the increasing complexity of analysis and visualization algorithms turn this last step into a HPC problem by itself and render the traditional workflow inadequate. The tremendous compute power and their advanced graphics capabilities make GPUs the ideal accelerator for modern HPC systems, enabling not only floating point intensive workloads, but also big data analysis and visualization tasks with the same massively parallel resource, enabling novel workflows like exploratory analysis or application monitoring and steering. In this talk, I will introduce some hardware and software features on modern GPUs supporting such workflows and present some use-case examples.

The discovery of new materials has an incredible impact on our daily life. Traditionally, the discovery of these new materials is extremely labor-intensive, requiring material scientists to analyse large numbers of documents and to conduct numerous experiments and simulations. As the number of documents published scales exponentially with time, this approach is not practical. Therefore, the field of material science is ideally suited for a cognitive computing approach. In this talk, we present how a cognitive computing approach can be used to improve our understanding and accelerate the discovery of new materials. We will discuss in detail how cognitive algorithms can analyse large number of documents and catalogue automatically extracted materials and their properties. Furthermore, we will explain how these extracted data can be used in simulations to extend our knowledge. In this way, our cognitive algorithms form an embedding for the traditional material simulations and extend their reach.

<strong>HPC for the Big Data Era</strong><br />
<br />
Big Data is rapidly expanding into the HPC domain. This is driven by computational needs of Big Data applications that render these characteristic candidates for HPC. At the same time, the ever increasing fidelity of models and simulations is changing traditional HPC applications to  data intensive workloads as well. These trends pose immensely interesting new challenges that span all the way from low level H/W design to programming environments and algorithms. How do we reconcile the need for massive I/O while bringing the computation as much as closer to the data. How do we merge the HPC and Big Data run-time and programming environments. What needs of cloud like virtualization can be answered by HPC knowledge and vice-versa. And finally, how do visualize immense amounts of data in meaningful ways. This minisymposium will attempt to introduce these trends and provide an overview of the landscape as well as a few directions for emerging designs, especially in view of exascale systems.

Realistic simulations of planetary dynamos will remain impossible in the near future. Especially the enormous range of spatial and temporal scales induced in convective flows by rotation plagues direct numerical simulations (DNS). The same scale disparities that hamper DNS can however be used to derive reduced equations that are expected to govern convection in the limit of rapid rotation. Simulations based on such formulations represent an interesting alternative to DNS. In this talk, recent efforts to test asymptotic models against DNS are reviewed. Results in plane layer geometry reveal convergence of both approaches. Surprisingly, Ekman layers have a profound effect in the rapidly rotating regime and explicitly have to be accounted for in the asymptotic models. Upscale kinetic energy transport leads to the formation of large-scale structures, which may play a prominent role in dynamos. The asymptotic models allow an exploration of parameter regimes far beyond the capabilities of DNS.

In a next generation dynamo experiment currently under development at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) a fluid flow of liquid sodium, solely driven by precession, will be considered as a possible source for magnetic field generation. In my talk I will present results from hydrodynamic simulations of a precession driven flow in cylindrical geometry. In a second step, the velocity fields obtained from the hydrodynamic simulations have been applied to a kinematic solver for the magnetic induction equation in order to determine whether a precession driven flow will be capable to drive a dynamo at experimental conditions. It turns out that excitation of dynamo action in a precessing cylinder at moderate precession rates is difficult and future dynamo simulations are required in more extreme parameter regimes where a more complex fluid flow is observed in water experiments which is supposed to be beneficial for dynamo action.

We study thermal convection driven by internal heating in a rotating sphere for low Prandtl numbers. Our model assumes that the velocity is invariant along the axis of rotation due to the rapid rotation of the system, while the temperature is computed in 3D. We find the presence of two dynamical branches: a weak branch that is connected to the linear onset of convection and a strong branch with large values of the convective and zonal velocities.

<strong>Understanding the Dynamics of Planetary Dynamos</strong><br />
<br />
Realistic numerical simulations of planetary dynamos are impossible to
carry out with current computational resources due to the extreme
conditions under which they operate. As a result, simulations are
performed with parameters values that are quite distant from those that
are typical of planets. How close are the current state-of-the art
dynamo simulations for a realistic planetary system? Are direct
numerical simulations the right approach for investigating the extreme
parameter regime that characterizes planetary cores, or is there an
alternative? This minisymposium aims to present the latest advances in
understanding the dynamics of planetary dynamos through well-established
direct numerical simulations, asymptotic modelling as well as novel
numerical algorithms.

The ParaDiS project at LLNL was created to build a scalable massively parallel code for the purpose of predicting evolution of strength and strain hardening and crystalline materials under dynamic loading conditions by directly integrating the elements of dislocation physics. The code has been used by researchers at LLNL and around the world to simulate the behaviour of dislocation networks in a wide variety of applications, from high temperature structural materials, to nuclear materials, to armor materials, to photovoltaic systems. ParaDiS has recently been extended to include a fast analytical algorithm for the computation of forces in anisotropic elastic media, and an augmented set of topological operations to treat the complex core physics of <c+a> dislocations and other dislocations that routinely appear in HCP metals. The importance and implications of these developments on the engineering properties of HCP metals will be demonstrated in large scale simulations of strain hardening.

The reliability of metallic nanostructures, such as, nanowires and thin films, is often dictated by their mechanical failures. An in-depth understanding in the effects of their intrinsic factors such as grain boundaries and surface roughness and extrinsic factors such as size, shapes and man-made notches on their plastic deformation mechanisms and failure patterns is of great importance in fabricating these nanostructures with high reliability. In this talk, we will first briefly review various deformation mechanisms and failure patterns in literature and highlight some of critical issues that currently are under active research. We will then report our recent progresses in the study of the effects of intrinsic factors, such as grain boundaries and dislocations and extrinsic factors such as sizes, shapes and man-made notches, on the plasticity and failure of metallic nanostructures using both mechanical testing and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.

Although the framework of Dislocation Dynamics (DD) provides powerful tools to model crystal plasticity, their efficient implementation is crucial in order to simulate very large ensembles of dislocations. Among all the steps involved in DD simulations, the computation of the internal elastic forces and energy are the most resource consuming. However, since they are long-ranged interactions, they can be efficiently evaluated using the Fast Multipole Method (FMM). We propose a new FMM formulation based on polynomial interpolations, that is optimised to reduce the memory footprint and the number of flops using fast Fourier transforms. These optimisations are necessary because of the tensorial nature of the kernel and the unusual memory requirements of this application. Regarding parallelism, our code benefits from a hybrid OpenMP/MPI paradigm and a cache-aware data structure. Numerical results will be presented to show the accuracy of this new approach and its parallel scalability.

Titanium alloys are used for manufacturing highly stressed components of gas turbine engine such as discs and blades due to their low density, excellent corrosion resistance and high fatigue strength. However, it has been reported that these alloys exhibit a significant fatigue life reduction, called dwell debit, under cyclic loading that includes a hold at the peak stress. In this study, a rate-dependent crystal plasticity framework was first used to reproduce the experimentally observed macroscopic response of Ti624x (x = 2 and 6) alloys under low-cycle fatigue and low-cycle dwell fatigue loading, which enabled relevant material constants for the two alloys to be determined. These were then utilized in a discrete dislocation plasticity model using the same thermally activated rate controlling mechanism to examine the dwell behaviour of the alloys.

<br />
HCP metals such as Mg, Ti and Zr are a class of lightweight and/or highly durable metals with critical structural applications in the automotive, aerospace and nuclear industries. However, the fundamental mechanisms of deformation, strengthening and ductility in them are not well-understood, resulting in significant challenges in their plasticity models at all scales. We present the <c+a> dislocation cross-slips in Mg using a DFT-validated interatomic potential and very large scale NEB calculations on HPC systems. We reveal a unique dislocation cross-slip mechanism and quantify the cross-slip energy barrier and its stress-dependence, which leads to tension-compression asymmetry and a switch in absolute stability of slip planes. All these are generic to HCP metals but very different from those well-established for cubic metals. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the <c+a> cross-slip behaviour, rationalize the pyramidal I/II slip stability and enable the prediction of slip trends across the family of HCP metals.

<strong>Applications and Algorithms for HPC in Solid Mechanics I: Plasticity</strong><br />
<br />
Plastic deformation is made possible by the motion of interacting crystalline defects. In the study of the mechanisms controlling the macroscopic and effective plastic laws, it is of particular importance to understand the collective behaviour of dislocations. Available models generally represent dislocations with nodes connected with segments which can form a complex network structure. Within these forests, dislocations can nucleate, interact, join, annihilate. This forms an important challenge because of the many defaults present in the crystals such as impurities, grain boundaries and free surfaces. In order to capture the correct physics of the described processes, the employed (self-) interaction laws and the mobility laws have to be correctly acknowledged. Furthermore, the number of dislocation segments need to be important if one wants to achieve calculations comparable with experimental scales. In parallel, full atomistic simulations can provide insights into detailed mechanistic aspects of dislocation nucleation, transformation, and reactions that occur at the nanoscale, below the capabilities of mesoscale dislocation models.  Consequently, the numerical calculations are challenging and call for HPC strategies. This minisymposium aims at fostering discussion on the newest advancements of the numerical models, accompanying algorithms, and applications. Also, we encourage researchers working in the field of dislocation plasticity to present analytic models and experimental results that complement studies performed with parallel algorithms.

Many problems in economics and game theory can be formulated as systems of polynomials. Methods from commutative algebra and numerical algebraic geometry can be used to find all solutions but the computational costs rise significantly as the size increases. Mathematicians have developed methods that exploit parallelism but have deployed them only on small systems.

The project deploys statistical and computational techniques to develop a novel approach to causality inference in multivariate time-series of economical data on equity and credit risks. The methods build on recent research of project participants. They improve on classical approaches to causality analysis by accommodating general forms of non-stationarity and non-homogeneity resulting from unresolved and latent scale effects. Emerging causality framework results in and is implemented through a clustering based on a minimization of the averaged clustering functional, which describes the mean distance between observation data and its representation in terms of given number of abstract Bayesian causality models of a certain predefined class. We are using finite element framework to propose a numerical scheme. One of the most challenging components of the emerging HPC implementation is a Quadratic Programming problem with linear equality and bound inequality constraints. We compare different algorithms and demonstrate the efficiency solving practical benchmark problems.

We show how sparse grid interpolation methods in conjunction with parallel computing can be used to approximate equilibria in overlapping generation (OLG) models with aggregate uncertainty. In such models, the state of the economy can be characterized by the wealth distribution across generations/cohorts of the population. To approximate the function mapping this state into agents' investment decisions and market prices, we use piece-wise multi-linear hierarchical basis functions on (adaptive) sparse grids. When solving for the recursive equilibrium function, we combine the adaptive sparse grid with a time iteration procedure resulting in an algorithm that is massively parallelisable. Our implementation is hybrid-parallel and can solve OLG models with large (depreciation) shocks and with 60 continuous state variables.

We show how active subspace methods, in conjunction with Gaussian processes and parallel computing can be used to approximate equilibria in heterogeneous agent macro-models. Using recent advances in approximation theory, we apply a combination of Gaussian processes and active subspace techniques to approximate policy functions in models with at least 100 continuous states. Moreover, we show that our method is perfectly suited for dynamic programming and time iteration on non-cubic geometries such as simplices.

We present a method for global sensitivity analysis of the outcomes of an economic model with respect to their parameters. Traditional sensitivity analyses, like comparative statics, scenario and robustness analysis are local and depend on the chosen combination of parameter values. Our global approach specifies a distribution for each parameter and approximates the outcomes as a polynomial of parameters. In contrast to local analyses, the global sensitivity analysis takes into account non-linearities and interactions. Using the polynomial, we compute the distribution of outcomes and a variance decomposition called Sobol' indices. We obtain an importance ranking of the parameters and their interactions, which can guide calibration exercises and model development. We compare the local to the global approach for the mean and variance of production in a canonical real business cycle model. We find an interesting separation result: for mean production, only capital share, leisure substitution rate, and depreciation rate matter.

This paper proposes an algorithm that finds model solutions at a particular point in the state space by solving a simple system of equations. The key step is to characterize future behaviour with a Taylor series expansion of the current period's behaviour around the contemporaneous values for the state variables. Since current decisions are solved from the original model equations, the solution incorporates nonlinearities and uncertainty. The algorithm is used to solve the model considered in Coeurdacier, Rey, and Winant (2011), which is a challenging model because it has no steady state and uncertainty is necessary to keep the model well behaved. We show that our algorithm can generate accurate solutions even when the model series are quite volatile. The solutions generated by the risky-steady-state algorithm proposed in Coeurdacier, Rey, and Winant (2011), in contrast, is shown to be not accurate.

<strong>Computational Economics</strong><br />
<br />
This minisymposium provides an overview of recent developments in how computational methods are applied to economic problems. These include, for instance, the inference of causality relations from large data-sets. Another example and focus of this symposium is the solution, estimation, and uncertainty quantification of dynamic stochastic economic models in fields like optimal taxation, asset pricing, or climate change. Solving such models is particularly challenging because of the feedback from the future that the expectations of the modeled economic agents create. This feature combined with the substantial heterogeneity that successful models of economic phenomena have to incorporate often results in dynamical systems with high-dimensional state spaces, confronting economists with the curse of dimensionality. Methods to alleviate this curse include adaptive sparse grids and active subspace methods. Moreover, such problems often require substantial computation time even if an efficient solution method is applied. Fortunately, the generic structure of many of these problems allows for massive parallelization and is thus a perfect application of modern high-performance computing techniques. This minisymposium brings together recent developments along those lines.

Many problems of great importance in systems biology involve inferring causal relationships among cellular components from high-throughput biological data. Such inferences typically face significant challenges due to the curse of dimensionality. This issue translates to solving an underdetermined inverse problem, for which there could exist multiple solutions. In this talk, I will present an ensemble inference strategy for addressing underdetermined causal inference particularly when using gene transcriptional expression data for inferring gene regulatory networks. In particular, I will introduce an inference algorithm called TRaCE (Transitive Reduction and Closure Ensemble) for identifying the ensemble of network graphs from expression data of gene knock-out experiments. Furthermore, I will describe an ensemble-based optimisation of gene knock-outs, called REDUCE (Reduction of Uncertain Edges). Finally, I will demonstrate that by iterating TRaCE and REDUCE, we could resolve the underdetermined inference of gene regulatory networks. These tools are available from our website: http://www.cabsel.ethz.ch/tools.

Models of codon evolution are widely used to identify signatures of positive selection in protein coding genes. While the analysis of a single gene family usually takes less than an hour on an average computer, the detection of positive selection on genomic data becomes a computationally intensive problem. In order to support our full genome database of positive selection 'Selectome' (http://selectome.unil.ch/) we develop a series of high-performance computing tools to analyse positive selection. These improvements allow us to develop new and more realistic, but computationally tractable, models of codon evolution.

Genomics-based biological research (e.g., next-generation sequencing) generates increasingly amounts of data, which need dedicated high-performance computing (HPC) resources to be analysed efficiently. However, the specialization in both areas (namely, genomics and HPC) makes it increasingly challenging to bring the two fields together and to leverage the usage of available computational resources by biologists. The mission of Scientific IT Services (SIS) of ETH Zurich is to bridge this gap and to provide client-tailored solutions for big data genomics. In this presentation, we illustrate this need and our approach by selected examples ranging from the design of automated, high-throughput NGS analysis workflows through addressing the biology "software stack jungle" to scientific IT education for biologists. Throughout the talk, we emphasize the importance of scientific data management, consulting needs and community building for using HPC in biological research.

Detection of positive selection on phylogenetic trees, where new advantageous genetic variants dominate in a population, is of a great importance to study gene evolution. However the high computational cost of such a detection in existing implementations limits its applicability. Taking advantage of modern parallel computing systems and clusters as well as different algorithmic techniques, we implemented a new software (known as FastCodeML) that substantially improve the limitations of existing solutions in terms of performance and scalability. We briefly introduce the underlying mechanisms of FastCodeML and discuss its gains over existing implementations.

While being noisy, redundant and ambiguous, the latter is generated by the many millions and contains key information for identifying active small and large molecules in complex biological samples. The library favours the fast and flexible implementation of customised analytical pipelines.

<br />
Orthology inference and other sequence analyses across multiple genomes typically start by performing exhaustive pairwise sequence comparisons, a process referred to as "all-against-all". As this process scales quadratically in terms of the number of sequences analysed, this step can become a bottleneck, thus limiting the number of genomes that can be simultaneously analysed. For the OMA database, developed in our laboratory, we have performed "all-against-all", between 2000 complete genomes, at a computational cost of several million CPU hours. In this talk, I will report on some of the strategies we have explored to speed-up the "all-against-all" step while maintaining its sensitivity.

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is currently investing in a scalability programme that addresses computing and data handling challenges for realizing those scientific advances on future high-performance computing environments that will enhance predictive skill from medium to monthly time scales. A key component of this programme is the European Commission funded project Energy efficient SCalable Algorithms for weather Prediction at Exascale (ESCAPE) that develops numerical building blocks and compute intensive algorithms of the forecast model, applies compute/energy efficiency diagnostics, designs implementations on novel architectures, and performs testing in operational configurations. The talk will report on the progress of the scalability programme with a special focus on ESCAPE.

Climate simulations using horizontal resolution of O(1km) allow to explicitly resolve deep convection. Precipitation processes are then represented much closer to first principles and allow for an improved representation of the water cycle. Due to the large computational costs, climate simulations at such scales were restricted to rather small domains in the past. Here we present results from a decade-long convection-resolving climate simulation covering Europe using a computational mesh of 1,536x1,536x60 grid points. We use a COSMO-model prototype enabled for GPUs. The results illustrate how the approach allows representing the interactions between atmospheric circulations at scales ranging from 1,000 to 10 km. We discuss the performance of the convection-resolving climate modelling approach and thereby specifically focus on the improved representation of summer convection on the continental scale. Furthermore we demonstrate the potential of online analyses of these simulations for assembling detailed climatologies of extratropical cyclones, fronts and propagating convective systems.

The importance of adapting numerical methods and the underlying algorithms to the hardware where these algorithms will be used is becoming crucial in many areas, including weather and climate modelling, engineering, finance, life sciences, etc. This aspect is even more important when targeting large HPC systems and will become a key for successfully produce large-scale simulations on the next generation HPC platforms. The current work explores a strategy being developed as part of the Horizon2020 ESCAPE project that tries to address this issue within the context of Weather & Climate modelling. In particular, we identified some key building blocks (also referred to as dwarfs) of Weather & Climate models, we isolated them and we created related self-contained mini-applications. These mini-applications can be tested on different hardware and re-adapted (eventually changing the underlying algorithms or changing the overall strategy) to achieve the best performance on different platforms.

Our aim is to adopt the COSMO limited-area model to enable kilometer-scale resolution in climate simulation mode. As the resolution of climate simulations increases, storing the large amount of generated data becomes infeasible. To enable high-resolution models, we find a good compromise between the disk I/O costs and the need to access the output data for post-processing and analysis. We propose a data-virtualization layer that re-runs simulations on demand and transparently manages the data for the analytics applications. To achieve this goal, we developed a bit-reproducible version of the dynamical core of the COSMO model that runs on different architectures (e.g., CPUs and GPUs). An ongoing project is working on the reproducibility of the full COSMO code. We will discuss the strategies adopted to develop the data virtualization layer, the challenges associated with the reproducibility of simulations performed on different hardware architectures and the first promising results of our project.

As the resolution of the forecasts produced by ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) is refined, the amount of data involved continues its geometric growth. Current peak loads already require an otherwise oversized parallel storage filesystem (Lustre). The data volume is expected to grow 6-fold by 2020, to reach 120TB/day, concentrated in short 1 hour bursts. Moreover, this data requires post-processing to create the final forecast products sent to end-users, introducing a further I/O bottleneck. Realizing these challenges, ECMWF's Scalability Programme aims to redesign the data workflow to minimize I/O in the time-critical path, whilst retaining resilience to failures. The authors are investigating multiple solutions to tackle issues of data locality, data volume and overall resilience. Solutions range from a novel NVRAM hardware co-design effort inside the EU funded NEXTGenIO project, to the use of distributed object storage technologies and a new dynamic worker-broker solution for managing the post-processing workload.

In weather and climate models values of relevant physical parameters are often uncertain by more than 100%. Still, numerical operations are typically calculated in double precision with 15 significant decimal digits. If we reduce numerical precision, we can reduce power consumption and increase computational performance significantly. If savings in computing power are reinvested, this will allow an increase in resolution in weather and climate models and an improvement of weather and climate predictions. I will discuss approaches to reduce numerical precision beyond single precision in HPC and in weather and climate modelling. I will present results that show that precision can be reduced significantly in atmosphere models and that potential savings are huge. Finally, I will discuss how to reduce precision in weather and climate models most efficiently and how rounding errors will impact on model dynamics and predictability. I will also outline implications for data assimilation and data storage.

<strong>Kilometer-Scale Weather and Climate Modeling on Future Supercomputing Platforms</strong><br />
<br />
The development of weather and climate models has made rapid progress in recent years. With the advent of high-performance computing (HPC), the computational resolution will continue to be refined in the next decades. This development offers exciting prospects. From a climate science perspective, a further increase in resolution will make it possible to explicitly represent the dynamics of deep convective and thunderstorm clouds without the help of semi-empirical parameterizations. From a computer science perspective, this strategy poses major challenges. First, emerging hardware architectures increasingly involve the use of heterogeneous many-core architectures consisting of both CPUs and accelerators (e.g., GPUs). The efficient exploitation of such architectures requires a paradigm shift and has only just started. Second, with increasing computational resolution, the models' output becomes unbearably voluminous, the delay from I/O unacceptably large, and long-term storage prohibitively expensive. Ultimately, there is no way around conducting the analyses online rather than storing the model output. This approach implies conducting model reruns (i.e., repeat simulations for refined analysis). These developments pose new challenging computer science questions, which need to be addressed before an efficient exploitation of new hardware systems becomes feasible. The proposed minisymposium is designed as an interdisciplinary workshop between climate and computer scientists, and its overall scope is the further development of high-resolution climate models. Specific aspects to be addressed include the numerical and computational formulation of non-hydrostatic dynamical models on heterogeneous next-generation many-core hardware architectures, the use of novel online analyses methods and model reruns in extended simulations, the virtualization of climate model simulations, as well as the development of bit-reproducible codes across different hardware architectures. Two of the listed presentations (those of Oliver Fuher and David Leutwyler) are centered around a recently developed GPU-enabled version of the COSMO model. This limited-area model is probably the first full atmospheric model that runs entirely on GPUs. It is currently evaluated in a pre-operational test suite for numerical weather prediction, and has already been used for European-scale decade-long climate simulations. Further development and exploitation of the model in a climate setting is currently being undertaken within the project crCLIM (http://www.c2sm.ethz.ch/research/crCLIM). The two organizers of this minisymposium are involved in this project.

First principles methodologies have grown in accuracy and applicability to the point where large databases can be built and analysed to predict novel compositions.The discovery process is rooted on the knowledge of descriptors: quantities that link selected microscopic features of the materials to macroscopic functional properties. To be useful, descriptors should be as simple as possible and, at the same time, reliable and transferable across chemical compositions and structural themes. Within the AFLOW consortium we have developed a simple frame to expand, validate, and mine data repositories: the MTFrame. Our minimalistic approach complement AFLOW and other existing high-throughput infrastructures and aims to integrate data generation with data analysis. I will present present examples from our work on novel materials for electromechanical energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and transparent conductors. My intent is to pinpoint the usefulness of our descriptors to guide the discovery process and quantitatively structuring the scientific intuition.

The high-throughput computation of materials properties by ab initio methods has become the foundation of an effective approach to materials design, discovery and characterization. This approach to materials science currently presents the most promising path to the development of advanced technological materials that could solve or mitigate important social and economic challenges of the 21st century. Enhanced repositories such as AFLOWLIB open novel opportunities for structure discovery and optimisation, including uncovering of unsuspected compounds, metastable structures and correlations between various properties. However, the practical realization of these opportunities depends on the the design of efficient algorithms for electronic structure simulations of realistic material systems beyond the limitations of the current standard theories. In this talk, I will review recent progress in theoretical and computational tools, and in particular, discuss the development and validation of novel functionals within Density Functional Theory and of local basis representations for effective ab initio tight-binding schemes.

As a crucial step towards the identification of novel and promising 2D materials, we provide here a large scale first-principles exploration and characterization of such compounds. From a combination of 480,000 structures harvested from the ICSD and COD databases, three-dimensional crystals are screened systematically by checking the absence of chemical bonds between adjacent layers, identifying more than 6,000 layered systems. Then DFT calculations of the van der Waals interlayer bonding are performed with automatic workflows, while systematically assessing the metallic, insulating or magnetic character of the materials obtained. Following full atomic and cell relaxations, phonon dispersions are computed as a first step towards the assessment of thermodynamic properties. Thanks to the AiiDA materials' informatics platform [1], and in particular its automatic workflow engine, database structure, sharing capabilities, and pipelines to/from crystallographic repositories, the systematic and reproducible calculation of these properties becomes straightforward, together with seamless accessibility and sharing.

I give a brief overview of our recently launched software framework for large-scale database-driven high-throughput computation, with a few examples of recent applications. The High-throughput toolkit (httk) is a comprehensive open-source software library that enables preparation, execution, and analysis of ab initio simulations in high-throughput with a high level of automatization. The framework also comprises functionality for sharing cryptographically signed result sets with other researchers. This framework powers our online materials-genome-type repository of ab inito predicted materials properties at http://openmaterialsdb.se. Examples of recent use of httk are the generation of training data for a machine learning model used to predict formation energies of 2M Elpasolite (ABC2D6) crystals (arXiv:1508.05315 [physics.chem-ph]) and to analyse phase stability of a class of materials based on substitutions into AlN. Current work in progress includes extending the toolkit for our ongoing research into the use of big data methods for materials design.

Magnetic materials underpin many modern technologies, but their development is a long and often unpredictable process, and only about two dozen feature in mainstream applications. Here we describe a systematic pathway to the discovery of novel magnetic materials, presenting an unprecedented throughput and discovery speed. An extensive electronic structures library of Heusler alloys is filtered for those alloys displaying magnetic order and thermodynamical stability. A full stability analysis for intermetallic Heuslers made only of transition metals (36,540 prototypes) results in 248 thermodynamically stable but only 20 magnetic. The magnetic ordering temperature, Tc, is then estimated by a regression calibrated on the experimental values of about 60 known compounds. As a final validation we have grown two new magnets: Co2MnTi, displays a remarkably high Tc in perfect agreement with the predictions, and Mn2PtPd is a complex antiferromagnet. Our work paves the way for large-scale high-speed design of novel magnetic materials.

<strong>Materials Design by High-Throughput Ab Initio Computing</strong><br />
<br />
Materials advances often drive technological innovation (faster computers, more efficient solar cells, more compact energy storage). Experimental discovery of new materials suitable for specific applications is, however, a complex task, relying on high costs and time-consuming procedures of synthesis. Computational materials science is now powerful enough for predicting many materials properties even before synthesizing those materials in the lab and appears as a cheap basis to orient experimental searches efficiently. Recent advances in computer speed and first-principles algorithms have led to the development of fast and robust codes, making it possible to do large numbers of calculations automatically. This is the burgeoning area of high-throughput first-principles computation. The concept though simple is very powerful. High-throughput calculations are used to create large databases containing the calculated properties of existing and hypothetical materials. These databases can then be intelligently interrogated, searching for materials with desired properties and so removing the guesswork from materials design. Various open-domain on-line repositories have appeared to make these databases available to everyone. Areas of applications include solar materials, topological insulators, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, materials for catalysis, battery materials, etc. While it has reached a good level of maturity, the high-throughput first-principles approach still requires many improvements. Several important properties and classes of materials have not been dealt with yet, and further algorithm implementations, repositories and data-mining interfaces are necessary. This minisymposium will be devoted to the presentation of the most recent developments in this field. It will also provide an agora for some of the leading researchers to put forward the most recent achievements, to address the current challenges, and to discuss the most promising directions. The speakers will be selected to illustrate the many disciplines that are contributing to this effort, covering practical applications (e.g., magnetic materials, thermoelectrics, transparent conductors, 2D materials), theoretical developments (e.g., novel functionals within Density Functional Theory, local basis representations for effective ab-initio tight-binding schemes), and technical aspects (e.g., high-throughput frameworks).

Astrophysical N-body problems range from planetary system to galaxies and the whole universe. The dynamical times of individual particles in such systems vary by many orders of magnitude. Therefore, N-body simulations employ individual adaptive time steps, which for reasons of efficiency are discretised and hierarchically organised (block-step). The N-body problem itself satisfies time-reversibility and it is therefore desirable that the simulation codes do too to avoid artificial dissipation. However, all current methods to adapt individual time steps with the block-step fail to preserve time reversibility. I investigate the seriousness of this violation and discuss possible ways to alleviate the situation. It appears that it is impossible to adapt the time steps reversibly with block-step in an explicit and efficient way, but nearly time reversible methods, better than current practice, are possible.

We present a new hybrid approach bringing the Tree algorithm for gravity calculation to the frame of fixed grid finite volume methods. The goal is to obtain a N log(N) complexity on cylindrical or spherical coordinate systems. The main property of our method is to build an approximate tree of the gravity field rather than a tree of the mass distribution. The algorithm has also the property to produce the exact gravity at some position of space (largest nodes of the tree). Finally, we show how fast and accurate the method could be on modern supercomputers.

We present a new time step criterion for gravitational N-body simulations that is based on the norm of gradient tensor of the acceleration that is not gauge invariance in all circumstance and based on the orbital time of particle. We have tested this time step criterion in the simulation of single orbit with high eccentricity as well as N-Body problem using direct summation force calculation and a Plummer model as the initial condition. This time step criterion requires fewer force evaluation than other time step criteria.

<strong>GENGA: A GPU N-Body Code for Terrestrial Planet Formation</strong>; Simon Grimm (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
<br />
<br />
<i>Co-Authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
GENGA is a GPU N-body code, designed and optimised to simulate the process of terrestrial planet formation and long term evolution of (exo-) planetary systems. The use of the parallel computing power of GPUs allows GENGA to achieve a significant speedup compared to other N-body codes. The entire simulation is performed on the GPU, to avoid slow memory transfer. GENGA uses a hybrid symplectic integration scheme, which allows a very good energy conservation level even in the presence of frequent close encounters and collisions between individual bodies. The code can be used with three different computational modes: The main mode can integrate up to 32,768 fully gravitational interacting planetesimals, the test particle mode can integrate up to 1 million massless bodies in the presence of some massive planets or protoplanets. And the third mode allows the parallel integration of up to 100,000 samples of small exoplanetary systems with different parameters.

Cosmological structure formation is a highly non-linear process that can only be studied with the help of numerical simulations. This process is mainly governed by gravity, which is the dominant force on large scales. A century after the formulation of general relativity, numerical codes for structure formation still use Newton's law of gravitation. In my talk I will present results from the first simulations of cosmic structure formation using equations consistently derived from general relativity. Our particle-mesh N-body code gevolution computes all six degrees of freedom of the metric and consistently solves the geodesic equation for particles, taking into account the relativistic potentials and the frame-dragging force. Thanks to this, we were able to study in detail for a standard &#923;CDM cosmology the small relativistic effects that cannot be obtained within a purely Newtonian framework.

We present the set of high accuracy direct N-body numerical simulations (up to N=6M particles) with the large scale different mass galaxy-galaxy collisions. We use our own developed high performance and high order (4th - 6th - 8th) parallel individual timestep Hermite direct N-body code (phi-GPU) with the maximum possible numerical resolution. For the simulation we use the largest astrophysical GPU clusters (including the TITAN GPU supercomputer in the US which holds second place in top 500 list). The code uses all the possible multi scale parallelizations (large scale MPI, local multi-thread CPU with OpenMP and local multi-thread GPU with CUDA). The central Black Holes (BH) are simulated as a special particles with the Post Newtonian force corrections (up to 1/c^7 terms) implemented for the BH versus BH interactions, which allow us follow the BH's gravitational waves mergers up to the final seconds.

<strong>N-Body Simulations Techniques</strong><br />
<br />
Many astrophysical systems are modelled by N-body simulations, where the simulated particles either correspond directly to physical bodies (such as in studies of the Solar system and star cluster) or are representative of a much larger number of collisionlessly moving physical objects (such as in studies of galaxies and large-scale structure). N-body systems are Hamiltonian systems and simulating their long-term evolution is a difficult numerical challenge because of shot noise, errors of the approximated forces, and strong inhomogeneities of the systems in both space and time scales. This latter point is a major difficulty for the development of efficient and scalable algorithms for HPC architectures.

HPC systems offer tremendous computing resources, often difficult to harness for Visualization applications. In fact, even though not often "massively" parallel, these applications can stress the system in numerous ways, while trying to execute in parallel on ALL subsystems (disk I/O, CPU, and GPU rendering). We will talk about VTK, an unarguably leading open-source Visualization effort which has been able to spread very early to the HPC world, and how it is today, embracing all new forms of parallelism, and advanced computing and data analysis methods and rendering. Through two end-user applications, VisIt and ParaView, we will give examples of scientific visualizations, and talk about the impact of VTK's latest release (its seventh major release) in the HPC world.

<strong>Data-Parallel Processing Using Madagascar Open-Source Software Package</strong>; Sergey Fomel (University of Texas at Austin, United States of America)

<br />
Many data analysis tasks in geophysics are data-parallel: the same process is applied in parallel on different parts of the input dataset. The Madagascar open-source software package provides a number of general-purpose tools to simplify data-parallel processing. These tools allow the user to develop serial code and easily run it in a data-parallel fashion on a multicore computer or a computer cluster. Different tools take advantage of different modes of parallelization (multi-threading, shared memory with OpenMP, distributed memory with MPI, etc.). They employ Unix-style data encapsulation to wrap serial code using forks and pipes. I will describe the current collection of data-parallel tools and will show examples of their usage in solving geophysical data analysis problems. I will also make suggestions for further development inviting input from the open-source community.

Within all domain-specific software projects, finding the correct balance between flexibility and performance is often difficult. In the seismic imaging community, the trend has been to move towards codes which are heavily optimised, but which often sacrifice usability and flexibility. Here we introduce Salvus: an open-source HPC high-order finite element (FE) package focused on full-waveform modelling and inversion, which is designed to be both flexible and performant. Salvus was constructed by following modern software design practices, testing protocols, and by establishing its foundations upon existing open-source high-level scientific libraries. The FE framework is generalized over spatial dimensions, time-integrators, polynomial order and wave-propagation physics, and provides support for both hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. Additionally, support is included for various numerical optimisation methods. We discuss our usage of existing open-source scientific libraries, our choice level of abstraction, and quantitatively investigate the performance penalties associated with these abstractions.

Over the past decade the open-source Madagascar framework has been used for reproducible computational seismology research by a growing community of researchers. While Madagascar is commonly used for single-node applications, the increasing number and the computational complexity of user-submitted software tools (e.g., 3D seismic modelling, imaging and inversion codes) are pushing the limits of computational tractability at the workstation level. There is a growing interest and community experience in using Madagascar for cluster-scale public HPC facilities and cloud-based computing environments. In this presentation we highlight our procedure for interfacing Madagascar with publicly accessible HPC clusters, and provide case studies of using Madagascar for large-scale 3D seismic modelling and imaging activities. We present our recent efforts of moving toward a reproducible Madagascar framework within a cloud-computing environment, and provide an example of running 3D acoustic modelling on Australia's NECTAR cloud computing grid using a combination of Python, ZeroMQ, and Cython.

Post-petascale supercomputers are now available to solve scientific problems that were thought unreachable a decade ago. They also bring a cohort of concerns tied to obtaining optimum performance. These include energy consumption, fault resilience, scalability of current parallel paradigms, workflow management, I/O performance and feature extraction with large datasets. We focus on the last three issues. The overarching goal is to reduce the time to solution. Experiments show that the imaging workflow suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks. Such limitations occur both for computational data and seismic time series. The latter are dealt with by the introduction of a new Adaptable Seismic Data Format (ASDF). HDF5 and ADIOS are used to reduce the cost of disk access. Because large parts of the workflow are embarrassingly parallel, we are investigating the possibility of automating the process with the integration of scientific workflow management tools, specifically Pegasus.

<strong>A Tetrahedral Spectral Element Method for the Seismic Wave Equation</strong>; Max Rietmann (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

<br />
<i>Co-Authors: Martin van Driel (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
Although the hexahedral Spectral Element Method (SEM) has become a standard tool in computational seismology, the main difficulty in applications remains the meshing: until today, no robust algorithm exists that allows automatic meshing of complex geological geometries. Here we demonstrate how the concept of the SEM can be applied to tetrahedral elements, for which such automated meshing tool exist. The key idea has previously been applied to the acoustic wave equation (Zhebel et al 2014) and consists in obtaining a stable quadrature rule with strictly positive weights by adding extra quadrature points in the interior of the elements. In this way, a diagonal-mass matrix is achieved while maintaining the order of convergence. We present the basic rational and show convergence up to fourth order in space and time. Finally, we compare our method and its implementation against the performance profile of existing hexahedral SEM implementations.

<strong>Open Source Software (OSS) and High Performance Computing (HPC)</strong><br />
<br />
Open Source Software (OSS) plays a fundamental role in research-driven projects and, for this reason, it cannot be neglected by academia and industry. OSS is radically transforming how software is being developed by various scientific communities and it is likely to be central to future research activities in many more fields. The process of development has to reach beyond organizational boundaries to unleash new potentials and open paths to new collaborations. OSS scientific applications are required to solve complex and data-intensive research problems. These applications range from smaller scale simulations developed on a desktop machine to large, parallel simulations of the physical world using High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. The minisymposium is focused on identifying specific aspects of Open Source Software for the development of scientific software that exploits High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures. This class of OSS applications includes software developed to perform, for example, modelling of wave propagation in the Earth and real-time visualization of great volumes of data. This minisymposium will bring researchers from various environments together to exchange experience, findings, and ideas in the realm of Open Source Software. The speakers will demonstrate a practical working success related to OSS and HPC and present future directions for where we need to go.

To leverage the computational power of many-core architectures of GPUs and Xeon Phi, suitable software library interfaces are required such that complex applications with many interacting components can be built. This talk discusses new challenges that have to be addressed in software library development for using many-core architectures in computational science: First, different programming models, most notably OpenMP, CUDA, and OpenCL, are in use. The ideal software library supports all of these approaches. Second, it is not enough to optimise for a single architecture. Different device generations provide different characteristics such as cache or scratchpad memory sizes; thus, a single optimised kernel is not sufficient. Third, extensive testing and performance monitoring require the availability of physical hardware; virtual machines are not enough. The audience will learn how these challenges are addressed in the ViennaCL library and which future directions are taken for further improvement.

VexCL is a C++ vector expression template library for fast GPGPU prototyping and development. It provides convenient notation for various vector operations, and generates OpenCL/CUDA kernels on the fly from C++ expressions. Among the challenges met during the library development were the need to support multiple backends (OpenCL/CUDA), the fact that the OpenCL compute kernel language is C99 and thus lacks some conveniences of C++, etc. The talk provides brief overview of the library implementation and the C++ techniques used to overcome the difficulties.

A significant amount of future exascale-class high performance computer systems are projected to be of heterogeneous nature, featuring "standard" as well as "accelerated" resources. A software infrastructure that claims applicability for such systems must be able to meet their inherent challenges: multiple levels of parallelism, complex topologies, asynchronicity, and abstraction. The "General, Hybrid, and Optimized Sparse Toolkit" (GHOST) is an open-source library of building blocks for sparse linear algebra algorithms on current and future large-scale systems. Being built on the "MPI+X" paradigm, it provides truly heterogeneous data parallelism and a light-weight and affinity-aware tasking mechanism for multicore CPUs, Nvidia GPUs, and the Intel Xeon Phi. Important design decisions are described with respect to the challenges posed by modern heterogeneous supercomputers and recent algorithmic developments. Implementation details which are indispensable for achieving high efficiency are pointed out and their necessity is justified by performance measurements or predictions based on performance models.

HPC libraries have provided abstractions for common and performance critical operations for decades. When uniform memory architectures were predominant, the main focus of library implementers was algorithm implementation, while data structures and layout had a secondary role. As memory architectures become more diverse, it became necessary to adjust simultaneously algorithmic needs and memory characteristics. Several recent library approaches tackle this problem, especially as performance portability is now essential. In this talk we will describe two libraries that address these issues: Kokkos and GridTools. Kokkos provides two fundamental abstractions: one for dispatching work for parallel execution and one for managing multidimensional arrays with polymorphic layouts. GridTools' main abstraction allows a programmer to describe complex stencil applications in an architecture agnostic way. Both libraries use the template mechanisms in C++ for high flexibility, thus avoiding source-to-source translators and proprietary annotations.

<strong>Software Libraries in Computational Science for Many-Core Architectures</strong><br />
<br />
Many-core architectures such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and many integrated cores (MIC) emerged in scientific computing. The efficient use of these architectures, however, is very challenging from the algorithmic perspective, as fine-grained parallelism needs to be fully exposed in the software stack. However, many widely-used libraries in scientific computing today were designed for processors with only a few cores and hence struggle to provide good support for such many-core architectures. At the same time, new libraries designed especially for GPUs and MIC emerge. The speakers in this minisymposium are developers of software libraries for GPUs and MIC and explain their approaches. They discuss strategies for dealing with the subtle differences of these architectures in order to provide portable performance on the users' machines. The discussion also touches the design of new application programming interfaces which are simple enough for use by application scientists, but also provide optional control over important details for domain experts. Overall, this session presents the state-of-the-art in libraries for many-core architectures and sketches a path forward for making these architectures more accessible to a broad user base.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The use of stochastic optimisation strategies for first principles structure prediction is now well established. There are many examples of these techniques making genuine discoveries. Ab Initio Random Structure Searching (AIRSS), in which initial starting structures are randomly generated and relaxed repeatedly, is extremely simple, reliable and suited to high throughput computation. Typical functional materials are ternary, or quaternary compounds. It is important to perform a search over compositional space as thoroughly and broadly as possible. I will discuss how AIRSS may be used to do this, paying particular attention to pulling apart structures we have already found, to make new, random ones.</p>

Achieving near optimal performance on different architectures (e.g., CPUs and GPUs) with a single source code is sometimes not possible and requires refactoring of the most performance critical code towards a desired architecture. This is the essence of 'performance portability' and this situation has been observed in several cases involving numerical weather and climate models. To help alleviate this situation, we are developing a tool named CLAW whose function is to allow developers to encode architecture-specific transformations into a single Fortran source. Our tool utilizes source-to-source compiler techniques to extend the Fortran grammar in a simple manner that allows the developer to activate the necessary code transformations automatically before compilation. To generalize the capabilities of the CLAW tool, we currently consider its use in the COSMO weather model and HAMMOZ and ICON climate models.

The recent increase of the computational power enables running of climate simulations at the kilometer-scale resolution. This modeling approach is able to explicitly resolve deep convection (i.e., thunderstorms and rain showers), and thus allows reducing some of the key uncertainties in current climate models.
 
Here we present analyses of decade-long climate change simulations at horizontal resolution of 2.2km across a greater Alpine region. The simulations have been conducted on a Cray XE6 system using a setup with 2000 cores on a computation mesh of 500x500x60 grid points. The results show great improvement in the simulation of summer precipitation, and demonstrate the importance of kilometer-scale resolution in climate change projections.

<strong>From Code to Climate: Adjusting Free Parameters in a Global Climate Model</strong>, Doris Folini (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
<br /><br />
<i>Co-authors: Martin Wild (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
The discretization of global climate models (GCMs) is too coarse to resolve a number of climate relevant processes. For example, the deep convection associated with tropical thunderstorms is of key relevance for the global atmospheric circulation, yet it enters GCMs only via sub-grid-scale parameterization of thunderstorms. Typically, such parameterizations come with some free parameters that need adjusting in order to obtain a 'physically meaningful climate', a process referred to as 'model tuning'. We illustrate this process at the example of MPI-ESM-HAM, the Max Planck Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) coupled to the Hamburg Aerosol Module (HAM) and discuss how we cope with three associated computational challenges: the high dimensionality of the parameter space, the substantial year-to-year variability of the model climate as compared to the long term mean climate, and response time scales to changes in tuning parameters that range from under a year to several centuries or longer.

Despite its far-reaching applications, there is almost no work on applying stochastic approximation and interior-point optimization, although IPM are particularly efficient in large-scale nonlinear optimization due to their attractive worst-case complexity. We present a massively parallel stochastic IPM method and apply it to stochastic PDE problems such as boundary control and optimization of complex electric power grid systems under uncertainty.

In many scientific and engineering applications one has to deal with curved
geometries. Such domains can accurately be approximated e.g., by unstructured
grids and iso-parametric finite elements. We present a novel approach here
that is well-suited to our concept of hierarchical hybrid grids (HHG). The
latter was shown to achieve excellent performance and scalability even
for extreme numbers of DOFs by a matrix-free implementation and exploiting
regularity of access patterns. In our approach FE stencils are not assembled
exactly, but approximated by low order polynomials and evaluated with an
efficient incremental algorithm. We demonstrate the accuracy achieved
as well as the computational efficiency using our prototypical HHG-based
mantle convection solver which operates on non-nested triangulations of a
thick spherical shell. The implementation of our scheme is based on a
systematic node-level performance analysis and maintains the high efficiency
of the original HHG.

This work introduces a code which solves a diffusion-reaction problem using a Discontinuous Galerkin method.
We have designed this code in order to exploit the full potential of GPU architectures.
The sparse matrix-vector product, fundamental in iterative solvers, is a critical point for GPUs.
 
The locality of Discontinuous Galerkin methods let us implement the stiffness matrix-vector product as a stencil code.
The "actions" of local operators are applied directly to the vector of the global degrees of freedom.
The implementation is matrix-free; only the vectors of the degrees of freedom and the mesh data are stored in the GPU memory.
 
Our stiffness matrix-vector product implementation has shown good scalability on CSCS's Piz Daint system.
 
The code has been developed as a master thesis project by Paolo Gorlani.
The thesis supervisors are Prof.ssa P. F. Antonietti and Prof. L. Bonaventura, both from MOX.

The simulation of fluids exhibiting non-isothermal and non-Newtonian behavior is of great relevance to a multitude of industrial applications.
However, setting up discretization and solver components as well as parallelizing and optimizing involved code is quite challenging.
One possible remedy is using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in conjunction with code generation techniques, as pursued by project ExaStencils.
 
In this work, we present our advances in fully generating solvers for such fluid flow problems from an abstract representation.
In detail, we examine a finite volume discretization of Navier-Stokes and temperature equations on a non-uniform staggered grid which is treated using the SIMPLE algorithm and geometric multigrid solvers.
This complex application brings new challenges, mainly considering automatically applied optimizations, but also many possibilities to enhance employed DSLs and, thus, greatly facilitate design and implementation processes.
We discuss these points in depth and provide convincing performance results for fully generated and automatically parallelized solvers.

CloudLightning is funded under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the call H2020-ICT-2014-1. It comprises eight partners from academia and industry and is coordinated by University College Cork. The objective of the project is to create a new way of provisioning heterogeneous cloud resources to deliver cloud services on the principles of self-management and self-organisation. This new self-organising system will make the cloud more accessible to cloud consumers and provide cloud service providers with power-efficient, scalable management of their cloud infrastructures. The CloudLightning solution will be demonstrated in three application domains: i) Genome Processing; ii) Oil and Gas exploration; and iii) Ray Tracing. Expected impacts for European cloud service providers include increased competitiveness through reduced cost and differentiation;  increased energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact; improved service delivery; and greater accessibility to cloud computing for high performance computing workloads.

In recent years, the CUDA programming model and underlying GPU hardware architecture have gained a lot of popularity in various application domains such as climate modelling, computational chemistry, and machine learning. Today, GPU cluster programming typically requires two different programming models that separately deal with on-node computation and inter-node communication. With dCUDA we present a unified GPU cluster programming model that implements device-side remote memory access operations with target notification. To hide instruction pipeline latencies, CUDA programs over-subscribe the hardware with many more threads than there are execution units. Whenever a thread stalls the hardware proceeds with another thread that is ready for execution. To make best use of the cluster interconnect, dCUDA applies the same latency hiding technique to automatically overlap on-node computation with inter-node communication. Our experiments demonstrate good and perfect overlap for compute-bound and memory-bound tasks respectively.

Rough boundaries impose several challenges to fluid simulations. Their difficulty stems from the fact that resolving the small scale rough geometry requires significantly refined meshes in the vicinity of the boundaries. Since all physical rough boundaries have a characteristic length, scale corrections on the standard Navier-Stokes equations can be obtained by considering Taylor expansions around the rough surface, leading to modified boundary conditions. Numerical tests are presented to validate the proposed theory including the calculation of drag and lift coefficients for laminar flow around a cylinder with rough boundary.
 
Key-words: steady state Navier-Stokes equations, periodic rough boundaries, drag and lift coefficients, laminar flow.

Covariance matrices arise in many fields of modern scientific computation from geostatistics to data analysis, where they usually measure the correlation between grid points. Most algorithms involving such matrices have a superlinear cost in N, the size of the grid. We present an open-source library implementing efficient algorithms based on randomized low-rank approximations (LRA). The library can provide approximate decompositions of low-rank covariance matrices in O(N^2) operations instead of the usual O(N^3) cost of standard methods. In addition, low-rank covariance matrices given as kernels, e.g., Gaussian functions, and evaluated on 3D grids can be factorized in O(N) operations using randomized LRA and an FMM acceleration. The performance of the library is illustrated on two examples: the generation of Gaussian Random Fields on large O(10^6) points heterogeneous spatial grids, and the computation of reduced-order maps given distances between DNA sequences using Multi-Dimensional Scaling for the classification of species on 10^5 samples.

Hash table implementations which resolve collisions by chaining with linked lists are very flexible with respect to the insertion of additional keys to an existing table and to the deletion of a part of the keys from it. For our implementation on GPUs, we use non-blocking linked lists based on atomic "compare and swap" operations. The deletion of list entries is done by declaring them as invalid and removing them. Typically, after a couple of deletion operations, our local heap is compacted. Using this approach, the initial build of the hash table and hash lookups perform comparably to the CUDPP library implementation. However, small modifications of the table are performed much faster in our implementation than the complete rebuild required by other implementations. We intend to use this novel hash table implementation for astrophysical GPU simulations with adaptive mesh particle-in-cell, which would benefit greatly from these new features.

Sequential programs compiled for today's heterogeneous hardware often exploit only a small fraction of available compute resources. To benefit of GPU accelerators the use of explicit parallel programming languages, pragma annotation systems, or specialized code generators is commonly necessary. We address the problem of <em>automatically</em> generating GPU code by developing a newly integrated heterogeneous compute compiler which - using latest polyhedral modeling techniques - automatically maps sequential programs to accelerators. For a range of applications we observe almost no performance regressions. On top of this baseline, we report performance improvements for a multiple computer kernels as well as two application benchmarks from SPEC CPU 2006.

SPH-flow is the one of the most advanced SPH solvers dedicated to high dynamic multiphase physics simulations. Over the last year, ECNantes has partnered with Nextflow-Software to deliver an accelerated version of the code on Piz Daint. This poster will present the results of this development activity.
 
After assessing the overall performance of the code, we focused on the Monaghan solver. We investigated strategies to improve its performance for an efficient execution on CPUs as well as GPUs, maintaining the scalability of the MPI version and high programmability. The keys to our incremental successes were being able to run a reduced version of the code, data types refactoring and workarounds for the limitations of the compilers.
 
This work should be of interest to academic developers because it details our experience using OpenACC directives for scientific computing in an area of cutting edge research.

<strong>Scalable Implementation of the FFT Kernel for Plane-Wave Codes</strong>, Anton Kozhevnikov (ETH Zurich / CSCS, Switzerland)
<br /><br />
<i>Co-authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
The application of the local part of the effective potential to the wave-functions is one of the known bottlenecks of the plane-wave pseudopotential codes. The reason for this is the underlying FFT kernel which is traditionally parallelized over the maximum available number of MPI ranks. Alternatively, the FFT kernel can be implemented on a two-dimensional MPI grid where row ranks take care of individual FFTs and column ranks are used for band parallelization. The 2D MPI grid approach to the FFT kernel and its performance are discussed in this work.

The novel non-stationary approach to causality inference of multivariate time-series was proposed during the recent research of project participants. This methodology uses the clustering based on a minimization of the averaged clustering functional, which describes the mean distance between observation data and its representation in terms of given number of abstract Bayesian causality models of a certain predefined class.
For analysis of realistic datasets we develop HPC library that is built on top of PETSc and that implements MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA parallelization strategies.
We present the mathematical aspects of the methodology and preliminary results of solving the non-stationary problem of causality inference for multivariate economic data with our HPC approach. The results are computed on Piz Daint at CSCS.

This project explores a technique called High-Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR), which allows for the decomposition of a function into a finite number of lower-dimensional component functions. HDMR leverages the lack of input correlation to effectively reduce dimensionality of the problem in exchange for accuracy. Due to the intrinsic separability and hierarchical construction, HDMR provides the opportunity for both embarrassingly parallel model estimation and adaptive selection of active or significant inputs. An application of HDMR in conjunction with Adaptive Sparse Grids is shown in the context of computational economics, in which we provide an efficient solution method for high-dimensional dynamic stochastic models. Our results show that HDMR can effectively capture model dynamics with relatively low-dimensional component functions, thus mitigating the so-called "curse of dimensionality" and allowing for computability of larger systems.

Deep learning is a recent predictive modelling approach which yields near-human performance on a range of tasks. Deep learning language models have gained popularity as they achieved state-of-the-art results in many language tasks, such as language translation, but are computationally intensive thus requiring computers with accelerators and weeks of computation time. Here we propose a parallel algorithm for running deep learning language models on hundreds of nodes equipped with Xeon Phis to reduce the computation time to mere hours. We use MPI for the parallelization among nodes and use Xeon Phis to accelerate the matrix multiplications which make up more than 75% of the total computation. With our algorithm experimentation can be done much faster thus enabling rapid progress in the sparsely explored domain of natural language understanding.

As information and communication technologies continue to expand, the need arises to develop analytical strategies capable of accommodating new and larger sets of social network data. Considerable attention has recently been dedicated to the possibility of scaling exponential random graph models (ERGMs) - a well-established family of statistical models - for analyzing large social networks. Efficient computational methods would be highly desirable in order to extend the empirical scope of ERGM for the analysis of large social networks.
We report preliminary results of a research project on the development of new sampling methods for ERGMs. We propose a new MCMC sampler and use it with Metropolis coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo, a typical scheme for MCMC parallelization. We show that, using this method, the CPU time for parameter estimation may be considerably reduced.

<strong>A Comprehensive Description of the Homo and Heterodimerization Mechanism of the Chemokine Receptors CCR5 and CXCR4</strong>, Daniele Di Marino (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)

Signal transduction across cellular membranes is controlled by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is widely accepted that members of the GPCR family self-assemble as dimers or higher-order structures being functional units in the plasma membrane. The chemokines receptors are GPCRs implicated in a wide range of physiological and non-physiological cell processes. These receptors represent prime targets for therapeutic intervention in a wide spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, cancer and HIV.
The CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors are two of the manly studied playing crucial roles in different pathologies.
In this scenario the use of computational techniques able to describe complex biological processes such as protein dimerization acquires a great importance. Combining coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics (MetaD) we are able to describe the mechanism of dimer formation, capturing multiple association and dissociation events allowing to compute a detailed free energy landscape of the process.

<strong>Generating Very Large Spectral Libraries for Targeted Proteomics Analysis Using Spectronaut</strong>, Tejas Gandhi (Biognosys AG, Switzerland)

<br />
Mass spectrometer (MS) based data-independent acquisition with targeted analysis offers new possibilities for highly multiplexed peptide and protein quantification experiments. This type of analysis often includes a spectral library as a prerequisite. In layman's terms, a spectral library is a collection of fingerprints that facilitates the identification of signals measured by the MS. Both the size and the quality of a spectral library, acting as a template for these target signals, can make a significant difference in the quality of the data analysis.
 
Recently, the trend has been moving towards generating very large spectral libraries consisting of hundreds of thousands of peptides stemming from tens of thousands of proteins. From a software engineering perspective, the challenge then is to process and manage such large libraries in an efficient manner. Here we present our solution towards generating very large spectral libraries while using a standard gaming workstation.

Immersed boundary methods have become the most usable and useful tools for simulation of
biomedical fluid-structure interaction, e.g., in the aortic valve of human heart. In such problems,
complex geometry and motion of the soft tissue impose significant computational cost for bodyfitted-mesh methods. Resorting to a fixed Eulerian grid for the flow simulation along with the
immersed boundary method to model the interaction with the soft tissue eliminates the expensive
mesh generation and updating costs. Nevertheless, the computational cost for the geometry
operations including adaptive search algorithms are still significant. Herein, we implemented the
immersed boundary kernels with CUDA to be transferred and executed on thousands of parallel
threads on the general purpose GPU. Host-device memory optimisation along with optimal usage
of GPU multiprocessors results in a boosted performance in fluid-structure interaction simulations.

<i>Co-authors: Juan Palacios (EPFL, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
The Blue Brain Project (BBP) and the Human Brain Project aim to improve our understanding of the human brain through data-driven modelling and whole brain simulation. Advanced computing technologies enable such projects to study problems that were unmanageable until recently. Care must be taken in the development process to ensure that the software developed is usable and maintainable over the project lifetime. Best practices range from documentation, code review, continuous integration, test coverage, to functional and integration testing. While common in industrial environments, these best practices are not yet common in more academic scientific projects.
 
Within the BBP, we are developing scientific software to synthesize biologically realistic neuronal morphologies for large-scale brain simulations. We discuss how best practices are applied in different stages of our scientific software development process. We show how validation drives the development of increasingly complex models and demonstrate how modular design benefits future use through examples.

<strong>Replica-Exchange Enveloping Distribution Sampling: A Robust and Accurate Method to Calculate Multiple Free Energy Differences from a Single Simulation</strong>, Dominik Sidler (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

<br />
Enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) presents an attractive alternative to standard methods for the calculation of free-energy differences &#8710;G from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, as it allows the estimation of &#8710;G between multiple states from a single simulation of a reference state R. The challenge of the approach is the determination of optimal parameters for R to ensure equal sampling of all end states. While an automatic selection procedure is available for two end states, the determination of optimal R-parameters for multiple end states is currently an unsolved issue. To address this, we have generalized the replica-exchange EDS (RE-EDS) methodology, previously developed for constant-pH MD. By exchanging configurations between replicas with different R-parameters, major parts of the parameter-choice problem can be circumvented, resulting in a reliable, robust and accurate method. We have evaluated RE-EDS using a test system with five inhibitors of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) studied previously.

The membrane permeability of cyclic peptides is likely influenced by the conformational behavior of these compounds in polar and apolar environments. The size and complexity of peptides often limits their bioavailability, but there are known examples of peptide natural products such as cyclosporin A (CsA) that can cross cell membranes by passive diffusion. The crystal of CsA structure shows a "closed" conformation with four intramolecular hydrogen bonds. When binding to its target cyclophilin, CsA adopts an "open" conformation without intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In this study, we attempted to sample exhaustively the conformational space of CsA in chloroform and in water by molecular dynamics simulations in order to rationalize the good membrane permeability of CsA observed experimentally. From 10 &#956;s molecular dynamics simulations in each solvent, Markov state models were constructed to characterize the metastable conformational states. The conformational landscapes in both solvents show significant overlap, but also clearly distinct features.

<strong>The Importance of N-Methylations for the Stability of the &#946;6.3-Helical Conformation of Polytheonamide B</strong>, Annick V. Renevey (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
<br /><br />
<i>Co-authors: Sereina Z. Riniker (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
Polytheonamide B (PTB) is a highly cytotoxic transmembrane cation channel consisting of 49 residues, of which more than half are posttranslationally modified. Epimerizations result in alternating L- and D- amino acids allowing the peptide to adopt a &#946;-helical structure stable in solution. The role of the other posttranslational modifications (PTMs): hydroxylations, side chain C-methylations and side chain N-methylations, is less understood. The importance of these PTMs for the &#946;6.3-helical structure is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Groups or individual modified residues are reverted to their precursor amino acids and the conformational effect on PTB monitored. The simulation results indicate that the N-methylations are crucial for the stability of the &#946;6.3-helix due to the formation of the side chain?side chain hydrogen bond chains that act like an "exoskeleton" for the helix. With unmethylated asparagine residues, the H-bond chains are unstable in polar solvents, resulting in the loss of the helical structure.

The UniProt knowledgebase is a leading resource of protein sequences and functional information whose centerpiece is the expert-curated Swiss-Prot section. UniProt data is accessible at www.uniprot.org (via a user-friendly interface and a REST API) and at sparql.uniprot.org, a public SPARQL endpoint hosted and maintained by the Vital-IT and Swiss-Prot groups of SIB. With 21 billion RDF triples it is the largest free to use graph database in the sciences. SPARQL allows scientists to perform complex queries within UniProt and across datasets located on remote SPARQL endpoints. It provides a free data integration solution for users who cannot afford to create custom data warehouses, at a cost for the service providers. Here we discuss the challenges in maintaining the UniProt SPARQL endpoint, which is updated monthly in sync with the UniProt data releases.

We present a Poisson solver with main applications in ab-initio simulations of nanoelectronic devices. The solver employs a plane-wave (Fourier) based pseudospectral approach and is capable of solving the generalized Poisson equation with a position-dependent dielectric constant subject to periodic or homogeneous Neumann conditions on the boundaries of the simulation cell and Dirichlet type conditions imposed at arbitrary subdomains. Any sufficiently smooth function modelling the dielectric constant, including density dependent dielectric continuum models can be utilized. Furthermore, for all the boundary conditions, consistent derivatives are available allowing for energy conserving molecular dynamics simulations.

A graphical-representation of a database[1] of more than 7000 molecules containing
non-homogeneous mix of C, N, O and S atoms has been generated using
a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm (sketch-map[2]) so that molecules with
similar composition and geometry are projected close to each other.
 
The underlying metric is based on the REMatch-SOAP kernel[3], which is built upon a comparison
of local environments[4], and treats the "alchemical" similarity between molecules, and the
location of atoms in space, on the same footings. Much like in a periodic table, one can also recognize strong correlations between the positions of the molecules on the map and their physical-chemical properties, from formation energy to polarizability.

The computational study of chemical reactions in complex, wet environments is critical for applications in many fields. It is often essential to study chemical reactions at the ab-initio level in the presence of the proper electrochemical environment. In this work we present a continuum solvation library able to handle both neutral and ionic solutions, solving the Generalized Poisson and the Poisson-Boltzmann problem. Two different recipes have been implemented to build up the continuum dielectric cavity (one using atomic coordinates, the other mapping the solute electronic density). A preconditioned conjugate gradient method has been implemented for the Generalized Poisson equation, whilst a self-consistent procedure enables us to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann problem. Both solvers and continuum dielectric cavities have been integrated into the BigDFT electronic-structure package. We benchmarked the whole library on several atomistic systems including small neutral molecules, large proteins, solvated surfaces and reactions in solution to demonstrate efficiency and performances.

One of the goals of the PASC project is to strengthen the networking in the Swiss material science community through active development of collaborative relationships among University researchers and CSCS staff.
This includes assisting researchers in tuning, debugging, optimizing, and enhancing codes and applications for HPC resources, from mid-scale to national and international petascale facilities, with a view to the exascale transition.
In addition, the application support specialists provide support for development projects on software porting techniques, parallelization and optimization strategies, deployment on diverse computational platforms, and data management.
 
Here we present selected tools and software developed for CP2K [1]. Furthermore we show exemplary how a CP2K application can be tuned to optimally use all available HPC resources. With a view to the next-generation HPC hardware, we present first promising performance results for INTEL's Broadwell-EP and KNL platform.

Understanding molecule-metal interfaces is crucial in current technologies such as molecular electronics, magnetism, and photovoltaic cells. However, due to the complex nature of Au(111) surface which possesses herringbone reconstruction, the interactions between molecules and the reconstructed Au(111) surface are still unclear. To fill this fundamental gap in the literature we apply Density Functional Theory to investigate the effects of both herringbone reconstruction and adsorption registry on the electronic structure of Co-Pyrphyrin(CoPy)@Au(111) complex. We found that the type of van der Waals schemes is important to get accurate herringbone structure of the Au(111) surface. Adsorption of the molecule is stabilized by the interaction of both Co metal center and cyano groups with under-coordinated Au atoms. PDOS analysis reveals that CoPy@Au(111) interface is influenced more by changing adsorption registry of the molecule rather than changing adsorption domains on the herringbone reconstructed surface.

With the available computational power growing, ever larger systems can be investigated with increasingly advanced methods and new algorithms. For electronic structure calculations on systems containing a few thousand
atoms, linear scaling algorithms are essential. For ground state DFT calculations, linear scaling has already been demonstrated for millions of atoms in the condensed phase [J. VandeVondele, U. Bortnik, J. Hutter, 2012].
Here, we extend this work to electronically excited states, for example, to make UV/VIS spectroscopy or investigations of the electron injection process in dye-sensitized solar cells possible. We base our approach on
non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, in particular on Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (EMD). The formalism, based on the density matrix, allows for linear scaling based on the sparsity of the density matrix and naturally
incorporates density embedding methods such as the Kim-Gordon approach.

Nuclear quantum effects neglected in most applications have been recently shown to have a significant influence on the calculated band structures of bulk liquids and solids and might thus be very significant for electrochemical properties.
We have calculated thermodynamic integrals as well as vertical ionization potentials (VIP) and vertical electron affinities (VEA) for two redox pairs, CO2/CO2- and HO2/HO2-, using DFT-driven thermodynamic integration using the classical and the quantum generalized Langevin equation colored-noise thermostats. It has been found that quantum nuclear effects lead to noticeable shifts in both VIP and VEA: the former is reduced, whereas the latter is increased for both pairs. As a consequence, significant effect cancellation is observed for the thermodynamic integrals computed with the classical and the quantum thermostats.

<strong>Probing Defects and Correlations in the Hydrogen-Bond Network of Ab Initio Water</strong>, Piero Gasparotto (EPFL, Switzerland)
<br /><br />
<i>Co-authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
Many of the unique properties of water are due to its highly-structured hydrogen-bond (HB) network, in which a dominant tetrahedral motif coexists with a plethora of different coordination defects. Due to structural constraints, coordination defects do not come alone, but clustered together. Here, we compute defect-resolved distribution functions from ab initio molecular dynamics to probe the radial and angular correlation between defects. We shed light on how fluctuations from the ideal tetrahedral structure contribute to the total radial distribution function of liquid water. We also present a systematic comparison of the concentration of different defects and the structural correlations between them, with a variety of simulation protocols. We show that regardless the details of the model, the qualitative predictions for the defect distributions are very similar. The most significant effect can be attributed to dispersion interactions, that impact the most on the relative populations of the various defects.

The key operation for linear scaling DFT implemented in the CP2K quantum chemistry program is sparse matrix-matrix multiplication. For such a task, the sparse matrix library DBCSR (Distributed Block Compressed Sparse Row) has been developed. DBCSR takes full advantage of the block-structured sparse nature of the matrices for efficient computation and communication. It is MPI and OpenMP parallelized, and can exploit accelerators. We describe a strategy to improve DBCSR performance.
DBCSR is available as a stand alone library at http://dbcsr.cp2k.org/ to be employed in electronic structure codes. To this end a streamlined API has been defined and a suite of tools has been developed to generate the full documentation of the library (API-DOC) by extracting the information provided directly in the source code. We give a flavour of the generated API-DOC by showing snapshots of selected HTML documentation pages and we sketch the design of such tools.

<strong>What Influences the Water Oxidation Activity of a Bio-Inspired Molecular CoII4O4 Cubane?</strong>, Florian Hodel (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
<br /><br />
<i>Co-authors: Sandra Luber (University of Zurich, Switzerland)</i>
<br />
<br />
We investigated the reaction mechanism of the recently presented first Co(II)-based WOC, [CoII4(hmp)4(&#956;-OAc)2(&#956;2-OAc)2(H2O)2] (hmp=2-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine), which is one of the rare stable homogeneous cubane-type water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) and the design of which has been inspired by nature's oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII). Two possible different catalytic cycles have been envisioned: A single-site pathway involving only one cobalt center and a water attack on an oxo ligand or, alternatively, an oxo-oxo coupling pathway where two terminal oxo ligands of the cubane couple and are released as O2. Using density functional theory and an explicit first solvation shell, we compare relative free energies of all catalytic states and analyze their stability and reactivity. Furthermore, we compute barriers and reaction paths for the water attack and O2 release steps. With this knowledge at hand, we propose possibilities to tune catalytic activity paving the way to informed design of high-performance PSII mimics.

We report on the status of the "DIAPHANE'" PASC project. The library contains modules to model the physical processes for energy transport by radiation and neutrinos that are most important for astrophysics. A common API is used to access each algorithm. The capability to model simultaneously multiple algorithms enables a wide range of new simulations such as, for example, the heating of gas by a stellar source and diffusion of that energy into a surrounding gas disk or nebula. Astrophysics applications include: supernovae; the formation of planets, black holes, stars, and galaxies. We demonstrate the current functionality and discuss some of the challenges and strategies in making the library modular, portable, and efficient for current and future HPC architectures.

We use high performance exact diagonalization to uncover the nature of the fractional quantum Hall states at fillings 5/2 and 12/5 under realistic experimental conditions. For both states we find the parameter regimes where they possess excitations with non-Abelian braiding statistics that can be used for topological quantum computation.

<br />
We present recent developments of GBS, a
simulation code used to evolve plasma turbulence in the edge of fusion devices.
GBS solves a set of 3D fluid equations, the
Poisson and the Ampere equation, and a kinetic equation for the neutral
atoms. Investigations carried out with GBS have significantly advanced our
understanding of the plasma dynamics at the edge of fusion devices. For
example, GBS simulations allowed the identification of the
turbulent regimes and the saturation mechanisms of the linearly unstable modes.
In GBS, a 3D Cartesian MPI communicator is employed,
leading to excellent parallel scalability up to 8192 cores.
To efficiently exploit many-core and hybrid architectures, new schemes using
MPI+OpenMP and MPI+OpenACC have been recently implemented.
We show the implementation of the new parallelization schemes, their
scalability, and their efficiency. The new parallelization allows the efficient use
of advanced hybrid supercomputers, such as Piz Daint at CSCS.

<br />
The supercomputing platforms available for high performance computing based research evolve at a great rate. However, this rapid development of novel technologies requires adaptations and optimizations of the existing codes for each new machine architecture. In such context, minimizing time of efficiently porting the code on a new platform is of crucial importance. A possible solution is to use coarse grain simulations of the application that can assist in detecting performance bottlenecks. We present a procedure of implementing the intermediate profiling for openQCD code[1] that will enable the global reduction of the cost of profiling and optimizing this code commonly used in the lattice QCD community. Our approach is based on well-known SimGrid simulator[2], which allows for fast and accurate performance predictions of the codes on HPC architectures. Additionally, accurate estimations of the program behavior on some future machines, not yet accessible to us, are anticipated.

Radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar atmosphere frequently
show shock fronts, contact discontinues, or steep gradients across
which radiative transfer needs to be computed in post-processing
steps. In view of applications to magnetohydrodynamic models of the
solar atmosphere, we have developed a new method for integrating
the equation of radiative transfer for polarized light across a
discontinuous atmosphere, using piecewise continuous reconstruction
and slope limiters. In this poster, we present a comparison of results
obtained with our new method and with more conventional methods.

Soft and accurate pseudopotentials are necessary for prediction of new materials. With the inclusion of non-linear-core-correction (NLCC) along with semi-core states to the Goedecker pseudopotential[1-2] we generated soft and accurate pseudopotentials for Perdew, Burke, Ernzerhof (PBE)[3] functional for H to Ar and few transition-metals. Through the Delta-Test[4,5], it is found that they are good for bulk systems where the average delta value is 0.15 meV/atom. The average error in atomization-energy of G2-1 Test Set is 1.32 Kcal/mol obtained using NWChem with aug-cc-pV5Z basis set.

<br />
Diverse modelling techniques that span large spatial and temporal scales are required to study the seismicity in subduction zones. Our seismo-thermo-mechanical (STM) seismic cycle models solve million year scale subduction dynamics and multiple earthquake events self-consistently, but fail to resolve the finer seismic time scale at which dynamic rupture models excel. By using the self-consistent stresses and strengths of our STM model as input for dynamic rupture scenarios conducted with SeisSol, the otherwise hard-to-constrain assumptions on these fields are resolved and advantages of both methods are exploited. The results show that a dynamic rupture can be triggered spontaneously and that the propagating rupture is qualitatively comparable to its quasi-static equivalent. The importance of both self-consistent initial conditions and dynamic feedback on fault strength is illustrated by a quantitative comparison of surface displacements and stresses.

<strong>Flexible Automatic Discretization for Finite Differences: Eliminating the Human Factor</strong>, Casper Pranger (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

<i>Co-authors: </i>
<br />
<br />
In the geophysical numerical modelling community, finite differences are (in part due to their small footprint) a popular spatial discretization method for PDEs in the regular-shaped continuum that is the earth. However, they rapidly become prone to programming mistakes when physics increase in complexity. To eliminate opportunities for human error, we have designed an automatic discretization algorithm using Wolfram Mathematica, in which the user supplies symbolic PDEs, the number of spatial dimensions, and a choice of symbolic boundary conditions, and the script transforms this information into matrix- and right-hand-side rules ready for use in a C++ code that will accept them. The symbolic PDEs are further used to automatically develop and perform manufactured solution benchmarks, ensuring at all stages physical fidelity while providing pragmatic targets for numerical accuracy. We find that this procedure greatly accelerates code development and provides a great deal of flexibility in ones choice of physics.

<strong>Imaging Subsurface Fluid via Poroelastic Theory and Adjoint Tomography</strong>, Neslihan Ozmen  (Utrecht University, Netherlands)

<i>Co-authors: Jeannot Trampert (Utrecht University, Netherlands)</i>
<br />
<br />
Poroelastic theory is essential in many geophysical applications such as imaging fluid-flow in oil reservoirs, monitoring the storage of CO2, and most topics in hydrogeology etc. Biot formulated the poroelastic wave equation in fully-saturated media. Based on Biot's theory, we aim to image the fluid directly in a regional seismic exploration setting. We simulate wave propagation in poroelastic media using a spectral element method. We define several misfit functionals and use adjoint methods to calculate the corresponding sensitivity kernels. The adjoint method is an efficient way for computing the gradient of a misfit functional with respect to the model parameters, and is based on the interaction between the time-reversed regular and adjoint field. Using those kernels, we perform gradient-based iterative inversions. We investigate in how far a poroelastic theory is effective for imaging the fluids, and study the influence of bulk properties, porosity, permeability and fluid-solid interaction on the results.

The explicit treatment of inertial waves imposes a very small timestep in dynamo simulations at low Ekman number. We present a fully spectral Chebyshev tau method that allows us to treat the inertial waves implicitly. The large linear systems that need to be solved at each timestep remain affordable thanks to the sparsity of the formulation. The simulations are parallelised using a 2D data decomposition for the nonlinear calculations combined with a parallel linear solver for the timestepping. Despite the increased complexity, significant gains in wall-clock time are achieved thanks to larger timesteps.

<strong>Optimal Utilisation of Piz Daint Memory Bandwidth for a Parallel GPU Two-Phase Solver</strong>, Ludovic Raess (University of Lausanne, Switzerland)

Massively parallel algorithms are commonly based on iterative methods. Such algorithms may run with optimal performance on very large systems, such the Cray XC30 Piz Daint at CSCS. The iterative methods require typically few calculations per transferred floating point number (low flop to byte ratio), and are therefore normally memory throughput bound. We developed a parallel GPU Two-Phase Hydro-Mechanical solver to resolve nonlinear fluid flow in transforming porous media. The key point for maximum performance is to optimally use the hardware's memory bandwidth when performing the minimum amount of memory accesses needed to solve the coupled equations. We show promising results of single GPU memory throughput close to memory copy values (i.e. when no computation is done), and optimal parallel efficiency and a linear scaling up to 5000 GPU nodes, i.e. the entire Piz Daint machine.

Atomistic computer simulations give access to increasingly accurate and predictive modelling of materials, chemical and biochemical compounds. As more complex systems become amenable to computation, the sheer amount of data produced by a simulation, as well as its intrinsic structural complexity, make it harder to extract physical insight from modelling. I will discuss how to build a robust, effective metric to compare molecules and condensed-phase structures, and how this can be used to represent large databases of compounds, building intuitive maps of chemical landscapes and singling out outliers and anomalous conformations. Furthermore, I will demonstrate the potential of this approach to machine-learn the physical-chemical properties of such compounds, that promises to circumvent the need for expensive quantum chemical calculations.

To simulate advanced electronic devices such as nanoscale transistors or memory cells whose functionality may depend on the position of single atoms only, a quantum transport solver is needed, which should not only be capable of atomic scale resolution, but also to deal with systems consisting of thousands to a hundred thousands atoms. The device simulator OMEN and the electronic structure code CP2K have been united to perform ab initio quantum transport calculations on the level of density functional theory. To take full advantage of modern hybrid supercomputer architectures, new algorithms have been developed and implemented. They allow for the simultaneous computation of open boundary conditions in parallel on the available CPUs and the solution of the Schrödinger equation in a scalable way on the GPUs. The main concepts behind the algorithms will be presented and results for realistic nanostructures will be shown.

Density functional theory (DFT) approximates the Schrödinger equation by modelling electronic correlation as a function of density. Its relatively modest O(N^3) scaling makes it the standard method in electronic structure computation for condensed phases containing up to thousands of atoms. Computationally, its bottleneck is the partial diagonalisation of a Hamiltonian operator, which is usually not formed explicitly. Using the example of the Abinit code, I will discuss the challenges involved in scaling plane-wave DFT computations to petascale supercomputers, and show how the implementation of a new method based on Chebyshev filtering results in good parallel behaviour up to tens of thousands of processors. I will also discuss some open problems in the numerical analysis of eigensolvers and extrapolation methods used to accelerate the convergence of fixed point iterations.

The diffusion coefficient of Li-ions is one of the key parameters in the design of high performance Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and defines a strict upper bound for how fast Li-ions can be inserted or extracted from the electrodes. In this talk, through accurate atomistic simulations, we will study the order effects occurring in half filled layers of LiCoO2 and propose an explanation for the experimentally observed dip in the Li diffusivity at this concentration. Surprisingly, it is found that the lowest energy phase of Li0.5CoO2 is a zig-zag pattern rather than the currently assumed linear arrangement and the diffusion in this phase is highly anisotropic, thus explaining the observed dip in the diffusivity. The atomic interactions are modeled at the density-functional theory level of accuracy and energy barriers for Li-ion diffusion are determined from searches for first order saddle points on the resulting potential energy surface.

Graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges (ZGNRs) show a great potential for use in spintronics devices [Geim et al., 2007]. We report a synthesis of atomically precise ZGNRs through a bottom-up approach on Au(111) surface [Pascal et al., 2016]. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal the existence of edge-localized-states in pristine and phenyl-functionalized ZGNRs. Using density functional theory calculations we show that such functionalization preserves the electronic properties of pristine ZGNR with a reduction in the energy gap which renders edge magnetism unstable to environmental influences. Furthermore, broken translational symmetry along the zigzag edge splits the two edge states into four. Magnetic instability is evident while modelling ZGNRs adsorbed on Au(111). A change in the van der Waals parameterization leads to decrease in the net magnetization and frontier states inversion at the Fermi level. Our findings show that an appropriate precursor molecule provides a route to engineering the electronic structure of ZGNRs.

Erosion damage in hydraulic turbines is a common problem caused by the high-velocity impact of small particles entrained in the fluid. Numerical simulations can be useful to investigate the effect of each governing parameter in this complex phenomenon. The Finite Volume Particle Method is used to simulate the three-dimensional impact of dozens of rigid spherical particles on a metallic surface. The very fine discretization and the overall number of time steps needed to achieve the steady state erosion rate render the problem very expensive, implying the need for high performance computing. In this talk, a comparison of constitutive models is presented, with the aim of assessing the complexity of the thermomechanical modelling required to accurately simulate the impact and subsequent erosion of metals. The importance of strain rate, triaxiality, friction model and thermal effects is discussed.

The demand of more energy combined with the requirement of reducing greenhouse emissions has made the developing of new electronic devices challenging. Improvements in the efficiency of applications like solar-cells, light emitting devices or semi-conductors are then required. In this context the possibility of tuning their electronic properties make Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), which are crystalline materials that combine inorganic metals with organic ligands, interesting candidates for the next generations of electronic-devices. At present the main limitation in electro-active MOFs is that the valence and conduction bands are localised either on the inorganic or on the organic part restricting their potential usage for magnetism and/or conductivity in which electron mobility is required. In this work I will show how through a combinatorial analysis the delocalisation between the organic and inorganic part has been rationalised allowing the design of hybrid materials with high magnetic and conductive properties.

A local resolution-of-identity (LRI) is introduced for Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory calculations using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) approach within the CP2K program package. The locality of the density fitting ensures that the linear scaling of the GPW approach is retained, while the prefactor for calculating the KS matrix is drastically reduced. In LRIGPW, the atomic pair densities are approximated by an expansion in one-center fit functions. Thereby, the computational demands for the grid-based operations become negligible, while they are dominant for GPW. The LRI approach is assessed for a wide range of molecular and periodic systems yielding highly accurate results for reaction energies as well as intra- and intermolecular structure parameters. Employing LRI, the SCF step is sped up by a factor of 2-25 depending on the symmetry of the simulation cell, the grid cutoff and the system size.

Numerical simulations of lubricated contacts (as in roller bearings, came-follower systems, gears) will be discussed. Finite-Element models can reach a quantitative prediction of friction and lubricant film thickness, as soon as heat exchanges are properly described both in the lubricant and in a sufficiently large portion of the bounding solids, whose heat diffusion can have drastic consequence on both friction and wear. But temperature should be fixed at some places (where?, which value?). We will show that a multiscale analysis, taking into account the whole mechanism surrounding the contact, would be required. The other way around, a local description of molecules flowing between the surfaces (e.g. using molecular dynamics simulations) would require the thermostating of at least a part of the molecular domain. How to impose temperature in this tiny space without disrupting the flow? Again this multiscale thermal problem in tribology should be solved by an adequate modelling.

There are many situations where the discrete nature of matter needs to be accounted by numerical models. For instance with crystalline materials, friction and ductile fracture modelling can benefit from Molecular Dynamics formalism. However, capturing these processes needs sizes involving large number of particles, often becoming out of reach of modern computers. Thus, concurrent multiscale approaches have emerged to reduce the computational cost by using a coarser continuum model. The difference between particles and continuum leads to several challenging problems. In this presentation, finite temperatures, numerical stability and dislocation passing will be addressed. Also the software framework LibMultiScale will be presented with its associated parallel computation design choices.

Deformation and fracture processes in engineering materials often require simultaneous descriptions over a range of length and time scales, with each scale using a different computational technique. Here we discuss some of the available multiscale coupling algorithms and their most interesting features from an academic and a corporate research perspective. We then present a high-performance parallel 3D computing framework for executing large multiscale studies that couple an atomic domain, modeled using molecular dynamics and a continuum domain, modeled using explicit finite elements. The main purpose of this work is to provide a multiscale implementation within an existing large-scale parallel molecular dynamics code (LAMMPS) that enables use of all the tools associated with this popular open-source code, while extending the robust CADD-type displacement coupling to 3D. Our implementation allows us to reproduce results of extremely large atomistic simulations using fewer than 1,000,000 atoms, thus at a much lower computational cost.

The strength of materials is mainly controlled by dislocations. Their dynamics include nucleations and multiplications at grain boundaries. Nonlinear atomistic forces should be considered to quantify nucleations, while, to correctly model dislocation pile-up, forces in far-fields are required. Atomistic (MD) and discrete dislocation (DD) simulations have been performed to study these dynamics. In MD, nucleations were naturally considered, but limitations of domain sizes persisted. In DD, dislocation interactions including pile-up were well described. However, ad-hoc approaches are required for nucleations. These limitations lead to couple these two method: CADD3D. In this talk, we present a multiscale model of a Frank-Read source using CADD3D. Several dislocations will be nucleated from the Frank-Read source in the MD zone, and develop as complete closed loops. As they approach the DD domain, they will be transformed as DD dislocations. An observable consequence will be work-hardening effects due to the pile-up back stresses.

Fracture remains one of the most challenging multi-scale modelling problems, requiring a concurrent description of the chemical processes occurring near a crack tip and the long range stress field driving it forward. This talk will discuss how these requirements can be met simultaneously by combining a quantum mechanical description of the crack tip with a classical atomistic model that captures the elastic behaviour of the surrounding crystal matrix, using a QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) approach such as the "Learn on the Fly" (LOTF) scheme. Strategies for the extension of this approach to provide effective constitutive laws at the continuum scale will be discussed, together with a recent information-efficient Machine Learning reformulation of the LOTF scheme, and finally if time permits some new work looking at how to couple QM and MM models using automatically derived site energies.

<strong>Applications and Algorithms for HPC in Solid Mechanics II: Multiscale Modelling</strong><br />
<br />
In all observable phenomena, a full understanding of the operative physical mechanisms leads to extremely complicated models. One natural analysis path is to decompose the problem into simpler sub-problems yet transferring part of the complexity to the issue of coupling the sub-problems. In the study of materials and solids, considerable progress has been made in the numerical methods to couple scales. For instance, atomic, discrete-defect, meso-scale, and structural scales can now be coupled together under various assumptions. In this minisymposium, talks are solicited to present new work on coupling strategies, their mathematical description, and/or their implementation details for possible HPC machines. Such multiscale methods could deal with multi-grid, FE², concurrent methods, particle-continuum coupling, among others. Other multiscale themes are also welcome in this minisymposium.

We discuss scalable solvers for the forward and inverse simulation of mantle flow problems. Crucial solver components for the arising nonlinear Stokes problems are parallel multigrid methods for preconditioning the linearized Stokes system, and a Schur complement approximation that is able to cope with extreme viscosity variations. To achieve good parallel scalability, we use, among others, matrix-free operations and we redistribute coarse multigrid levels to a subsets of all available processors. We will discuss the inversion of global rheology parameters and distributed fields from surface data and the present-day temperature distribution in instantaneous and time-dependent problems.

Laboratory experiments represent a great opportunity to study fundamental aspects of dynamic slip front propagation in a well-controlled system. Nevertheless, numerical simulations are needed to gain access to information that is experimentally unmeasurable but required to develop full understanding of the underlying mechanics. In this presentation, we discuss simulations that bridge two relevant scales for laboratory stick-slip experiments, which are the macroscopic structure and the meso-scale weakening process occurring at the interface. We show that these high-performance simulations reproduce quantitatively well experimental observations if both length scales are accurately modeled. Furthermore, we apply the acquired insights from the computational model to enable new experimental observations that are otherwise inaccessible, and to develop theoretical tools that are useful for the description and prediction of the mechanics of slip front propagation at frictional interfaces.

Lateral rupture limits substantially regulate the magnitude of great subduction megathrust earthquakes, but in turn, factors controlling it remain largely unknown due to the limited spatio-temporal range of observations. It however involves the long-term, regional tectonic history, including structural, stress and strength heterogeneities. This problem requires a powerful 3D-continuum numerical modelling approach that bridges tectonic and seismic timescales, but a suitable code is lacking. We demonstrate the development of a scalable PETSc-based staggered-grid finite difference code, in which self-consistent long-term deformation and spontaneous rupture are ensured through a solid-mechanics based visco-elasto-plastic rheology with a slip rate-dependent friction formulation, an energy-conservative inertial implementation, artificial damping of seismic waves at the domain boundaries, and an adaptive, implicit-explicit time-stepping scheme. Automated discretization and manufactured solution benchmarks ensure stability, flexibility and accuracy of the code at every stage of development.

The modelling of seismic elastic wave full waveform in a limited frequency band is now well established. The constant increase of computing power with time has now allowed the use of seismic elastic wave full waveforms in a limited frequency band to image the elastic properties of the earth. Nevertheless, inhomogeneities of scale much smaller than the minimum wavelength of the wavefield associated to the maximum frequency of the limited frequency band, are still a challenge for both forward and inverse problems. In this work, we tackle the problem of elastic properties varying much faster than the minimum wavelength, making it possible to link small and large scales for elastic or acoustic waves. Using a non periodic homogenization theory, we show how to compute effective elastic properties and local correctors. The implications of the homogenization theory on the inverse problem will be presented.

Numerical modelling of seismic wave propagation can be of great value at many scales, ranging from shallow applications in engineering geophysics to global scale seismology. Accurate modelling of the physics of wave propagation at different scales requires different spatial and temporal discretization and potentially also different numerical methods. We present a new method to dynamically link the waves propagating at these different scales. A finite-difference solver is used on a local grid, whereas the (much) larger background domain is represented by its (precomputed) Green's functions. At each time step of the simulation, the interaction between the events leaving the local domain and the medium outside is calculated using a Kirchhoff-type integral extrapolation and the extrapolated wavefield is applied as a boundary condition to the local domain. This results in a numerically exact hybrid modelling scheme, also after local updates of the model parameters.

Traditional three-dimensional modelling approaches to electromagnetic problems in geophysics work well in the cases when the resulting fields exhibit smooth variations on large spatial scales. However, the presence of highly conductive anomalies (e.g., metallic casing of the wells and other steel infrastructure) can affect the electromagnetic fields significantly. Extreme material contrasts and multiple spatial scales create serious computational challenges. Realistic interpretation of steel objects requires an extremely fine, millimeter-scale spatial discretization in a large computational domain whose size is of the order of tens of kilometers. Conductivity contrasts between steel and surrounding media can exceed 8-9 orders of magnitude. Even locally refined unstructured meshes lead to ill-conditioned problems with many millions of unknowns and hence require the use of high performance computing. In this presentation, I will give several examples of frequency-domain modelling scenarios when the presence of small-scale objects has a tremendous effect on electromagnetic measurements.

<strong>Bridging Scales in Geosciences</strong><br />
<br />
Complex, but relevant processes within the Solid Earth domain cover a wide range of space and time scales, up to 17 and 26 orders of magnitude, respectively. Earthquake propagation, for instance, depends on dynamic processes at the rupture tip over 10^-9 seconds, while the plate tectonic faults on which they occur evolve over time scales up to 100's of millions of years. While problems in imaging and modelling of mantle processes on the Earth's tens of thousands of kilometers scale can be affected by physio-chemical compositions varying on a meter scale and being determined on a molecular level. Besides these examples ample of other physical processes in geophysics cross the largest imaginable scales. At each of the characteristic scales different physical processes are relevant, which thus requires us to couple the relevant physics at the different scales. Simulating the physics at each of these scales is a tremendous task, which hence often requires High Performance Computing. Computational challenges include, but are not limited to, a large number of degrees of freedom and crossing the two-scale problem on which most computational tools are founded. To discuss and start to tackle these challenges we aim to bring together computer and geoscientists to discuss them from different perspectives. Applications within geosciences, include, but or not limited to, geodynamics, seismology, fluid dynamics, tectonics, geomagnetism, and exploration geophysics.

Numerical simulation of particle-fluid interaction finds its importance in a wide range of applications like erosion and sedimentation, industrial filtering processes, or the study of volcanic plumes. As far as numerical simulation is concerned, the literature in this field is restricted to cases of low or moderate Reynolds numbers, or to examples in which the motion of the solid body is restricted or completely inhibited (example: the numerical simulation of particle settling at low Reynolds number, dominated by the particle-ground interaction). This presentation introduces a new numerical method which overcomes these limitations and resolves the coupled fluid-solid motion in a higher-Reynolds regime. It focuses on the free fall, in air, of particles with a diameter of several millimeters. A major difficulty stems from the fact that the particles typically reach a terminal velocity around 20 m/s and a Reynolds number around 50,000, at which fluid turbulence is fully developed.

Biological modelling has become an important approach to study the evolution of genes and organisms. However, the increase in availability of large-scale genomic data is pushing for the development of high-performance computing approaches to model evolutionary processes. In this context, the availability of Bayesian approaches has been essential to extend the realism of the evolutionary models that can be used. The development of these methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques is however computationally intensive and requires high-performance computing approaches to deal with the computational complexity. Here, I will present our recent developments to optimise and parallelize MCMC techniques. I will also discuss our efforts to extend modelling of adaptation from genomic data to complex phenotypic traits using hierarchical Bayesian computations.

Can we simulate haemodynamics in a vascular district in real time? One single heartbeat still takes several hours on an HPC platform, how can we reduce the computational complexity of 2-3 orders of magnitude? The key ingredients are model order reduction and numerical reduction combined with pre-processing on supercomputers. Blood flow in arteries needs to take into account the incompressibility of the fluid, the compliant vessel, and the patient specific data. After reducing the complexity of the model,i.e. by assuming a fixed fluid computational domain and a thin membrane structure, it is possible to use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Reduced Basis Method to split the computational effort into an offline and an online parts. The former runs on a HPC system in 5 hours on 1000 processors, while the latter runs in real time, i.e. 1 second of simulations in less than 1 second of CPU time, on a notebook.

Blood flow and the associated diseases in the cardiovascular system are fundamentally multiscale where events at the nano and micro-scale trigger problems in coronary and larger arteries as well as major arteries and heart valves. For example, atherothrombosis is a critical common event in heart attacks and strokes. The accumulation of platelets (1 to 2 micrometer) into a thrombus (few millimeters) has been shown to be dependent on hemodynamics, especially the local shear rate in arteries (2 to 10 millimeters). To induce arterial thrombosis, shear rate affects two biophysical factors: a) convection of circulating platelets to reach the thrombus surface (flux), and b) affinity of the surface to platelet binding. Any computational simulation must consider blood flow at the cellular level. We shall discuss progress and challenges in multiscale simulation of blood flow at cellular level with HPC as a fundamental platform for gaining insight in many cardiovascular processes.

At cellular resolution, the entities of neural networks are neurons and their connections, the synapses. Already early parallel simulation codes stored synapses in a distributed fashion such that a synapse solely consumes memory on the compute node harboring the target neuron. As petascale computers with some 100,000 nodes become increasingly available for neuroscience, new challenges arise: each neuron contacts on the order of 10,000 other neurons but for any given source neuron, at most a single synapse is typically created on a compute node. Here we present data structures taking advantage of this specific sparseness. After introducing the relevant scaling scenario for brain-scale simulations, we quantitatively discuss the performance on two supercomputers: JUQUEEN and the K computer. The contribution discusses the largest general neuronal network simulation carried out to date, comprising more than a billion neurons, and provides the evidence that neuroscience can exploit petascale machines.

Cortical modelling has many unknowns, but the numbers of neurons and synapses can be accurately estimated. Downscaling, commonly used for feasibility, distorts network dynamics. Fortunately, full-scale modelling is increasingly possible. We develop a full-density multi-area model of macaque vision-related cortex at cellular resolution. A layered microcircuit model with spiking point neurons, customized with area-specific neuron densities, represents each of 32 areas. The inter-area connectivity combines the CoCoMac database, quantitative tracing data, and statistical regularities. The connectivity is refined using mean-field theory. Indegrees increase from V1 to higher areas, which therefore exhibit bursty firing and long intrinsic time scales. Inter-area propagation occurs predominantly in the feedback direction, as in visual imagery. At intermediate inter-area connection strengths, functional connectivity between areas corresponds well with macaque resting-state fMRI. The model achieves consistency of structure and activity at multiple scales and provides a platform for future research.

This talk will introduce the abstractions and simulation techniques for neural tissue simulations capturing the detailed morphology of nerve cells. Models of this type are characterized by low arithmetic intensity and potentially large memory footprints. The simulator of choice for these type of models is NEURON. Here we will present recent achievements in substantially reducing the memory consumption of the simulator as well as the scaling to large scale supercomputers such as the Juelich JuQUEEN or the Argonne MIRA system.

It has been called "the most complete simulation of a piece of excitable brain matter to date", by Christof Koch, President and CSO of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle [1]. After briefly reviewing the HPC-based data integration and reconstruction workflow, I will focus on simulation results obtained using the digital reconstruction of the microcircuitry of somatosensory cortex of P14 rat, running on the "BlueBrain IV" IBM BlueGene/Q system hosted at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS). We validated and explored the spontaneous and sensory evoked dynamics of the microcircuit, and discovered previously unknown biological mechanisms by integrating decades of anatomical and physiological Neuroscience data [2].

We present a semi-automatic process for constructing whole-brain models at the point neuron level from different sets of image stacks. In the first step, we determine the positions of all cells, using high-resolution Nissl stained microscope image. In the second step, we determine the type of each cell (glia, excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons), using in situ hybridization (ISH) image data and compare the resulting cell and neuron numbers to literature data. In the next step, we use two-photon tomography images of rAAV labeled axonal projections to determine the mesoscale connectivity between the neurons in different brain regions. Finally, we obtain a network model that can be simulated with state-of the art simulators like NEST and NEURON.

Brain functionality depends critically on the connectivity of neurons, which in turn depends on their morphologies. Therefore, to reproduce brain function through simulation of large-scale neuronal networks, it is important to use realistic neuronal morphologies. The classic approach where morphologies are reconstructed from experiments provides invaluable information, but is time consuming and does not scale to the number of cells needed for whole brain simulations. In order to increase the morphological variability available for such simulations, we are developing a framework for synthesizing neurons. We propose to create morphologies based on spatially embedded stochastic models: we combine biological morphometrics obtained from reconstructions with a virtual representation of the brain environment, which confines and guides neurites. We discuss the data structures and algorithms used to provide environmental information to the growing neurons, and demonstrate the current status of the synthesis framework.

<strong>Level of Detail in Brain Modeling: Common Abstractions and their Scientific Use</strong><br />
<br />
Brain simulation has been a modelling challenge to the same degree as is has been a simulation challenge in the sense that depending on the scope of the question the actual mathematical formalisms vary profoundly. At the same time, the decision for a certain scope and formalism is taken in light of the available data and computational tractability. Traditionally, researchers wanting to understand the function of brains accordingly have chosen a more "top-down" approach, trying to keep complexity to the minimum. Researchers interested in understanding the brain as a system (e.g., needed for diseases) have little choice other than to embrace more "bottom-up" approaches that incorporate the biophysical and even the biochemical diversity found in brain tissue. More recently, the steady increase of computational capabilities as described in Moore's law has reached levels that large scale and fine detail are achievable at the same time. Modern informatics workflows and technologies help us to make complex scientific team efforts more tractable and reproducible. Together with high-quality, brain-wide data sets at increasing resolution and specificity, brain simulation finally is on a journey that should make it possible to overcome the divide. The minisymposium highlights this exciting convergence and the two prominent abstractions to brain modelling and simulation. The first one stops at the resolution of individual nerve cells (point neuron modelling) whereas the second takes the detailed morphologically of neurons and their circuitry into account. We present two major simulation tools, NEST and NEURON, which are open source and community standards for their respective abstraction since many years. Since about a decade these tools are capable of running on massively parallel computers. Recently, they have been shown to be ready to exploit the class of petascale HPC machines. The minisymposium presents the computational characteristics and requirements of the codes. For both abstractions, we showcase specific neuroscience applications using the respective tools and representing cutting edge in silico neuroscientific research. The presenting researchers are members of the European Human Brain Project. The presented simulators are partially supported by that effort in order to integrate them into a novel research infrastructure for brain research. One contributed talk on point neuron modelling and simulation and another on detailed neuron modelling and simulation are presented.

G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) pathways are of high interest since their signal-transduction cascades play an important role in several diseases such as hypertension and obesity. The first proteins that will transfer an extracellular signal received by a GPCR to other regions in the cell are G protein heterotrimers. The specificity by which G protein subunits interact with receptors and effectors defines the variety of responses that a cell is capable of providing due to an extracellular signal. Interestingly, many G proteins have distinct lipidation profiles but little is known how this influences their function. Here, we investigate the effect of myristoylation on the structure and dynamics of G&#945;i1 and the possible implications for signal transduction. A 2 µs molecular dynamics simulation suggests conformational changes of the switch II and alpha helical domains emphasizing the importance of permanent lipid attachment in tuning the function of signaling proteins.

Computer simulations provide crucial insights and rationales for the design of molecular approaches in (neuro)medicine. I will describe three case studies to illustrate how molecular model building and molecular dynamics simulations of complex molecular assemblies such as membrane proteins help in that process [1-3]. Through selected examples, including key signaling pathways in neurotransmission, the links between a molecular-level understanding of biological mechanisms and original approaches to treat disease conditions will be illuminated. Such treatments may be symptomatic, e.g. by better understanding the function and pharmacology of macromolecular key players, or curative, e.g. through molecular inhibition of disease-inducing molecular processes.

Lipid composition may significantly affect membrane proteins function, yet its impact on the protein structural determinants is not well understood. Here we present a comparative molecular dynamics (MD) study of the human adenosine receptor type 2A (hA2AR) in complex with caffeine "a system of high neuro-pharmacological relevance" within different membrane types: POPC, mixed POPC/POPE and cholesterol-rich membranes. 0.8-&#956;s MD simulations unambiguously show that the helical folding of the amphipathic helix 8 depends on membrane contents. Most importantly, the distinct cholesterol binding into the cleft between helix 1 and 2 stabilizes a specific caffeine-binding pose against others visited during the simulation. Hence, cholesterol presence (approximately 33%-50% in synaptic membrane in central nervous system), often neglected in X-ray determination of membrane proteins, affects the population of the ligand binding poses. We conclude that including a correct description of neuronal membranes may be very important for computer-aided design of ligands targeting hA2AR and possibly other GPCRs.

Proteins are molecular machines, whose activity is linked to its ability to suffer conformational transitions as a consequence of external effectors, like changes in the environment, presence of drugs, or other macromolecules. Unfortunately, the representation of protein flexibility is complex as it is too fast for most experimental techniques, and too slow for simulation methods. I will summarize in my talks efforts done at Barcelona to develop a theoretical framework to provide a holistic picture of protein flexibility and dynamics.

Inward-rectifier K+ (Kir) channels are essential to maintain the resting membrane potential of neurons and to buffer extracellular potassium by glial cells. Indeed, Kir malfunction has been suggested to play a role in some neuropathologies, e.g. white matter disease, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Kir activation requires phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), a highly negatively charged lipid located in the inner membrane leaflet. In addition, the presence of other non-specific, anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), is needed for the channel to be responsive at physiological concentrations of PIP2. The dual lipid modulation of Kir channels is not yet fully understood at a molecular level. To give further insight into how the two lipids act cooperatively to open the channel, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that initial binding of PS helps to pre-assemble the binding site of PIP2, which in turn completes Kir activation.

<strong>Molecular Neuromedicine: Recent Advances by Computer Simulation and Systems Biology</strong><br />
<br />
Innovative neuromedicine approaches require a detailed understanding of the molecular and systems-level causes of neurological diseases, their progression and the response to treatments. Ultimately, neuronal function and diseases are caused by exquisite molecular recognition processes during which specific biomolecules bind to each other allowing neuronal signaling, metabolism, synaptic transmission, etc. The detailed understanding of these processes, as well as the rational design of molecules for technology advances in neuropharmacology, require the characterization of neuronal biomolecules' structure, function, dynamics and energetics. The biomolecules and processes under study are inherently highly complex in terms of their size (typically on the order of 10^5-10^6 atoms) and time-scale (up to seconds), much longer than what can be simulated by standard molecular dynamics approaches (which, nowadays, can typically reach up to microseconds). This requires the development of methodologies in multiscale molecular simulation. Recent advancements include coarse-grained (CG) approaches that allow to study large  systems on a long timescale, as well as very accurate hybrid methods combining QM modelling with molecular mechanics (MM) that provide descriptions of key neuronal photoreceptors, such as rhodopsin. In addition, Brownian dynamics are used to study biomolecular recognition and macromolecular assembly processes towards in vivo  conditions. Such computational tools are invaluable for description, prediction and understanding of biological mechanisms in a quantitative and integrative way. This workshop will be an ideal forum to discuss both advancements and future directions in multiscale methodologies and applications on key signaling pathways in neurotransmission, such as those based on neuronal G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These novel methodologies might prove to be instrumental to understand the underlying causes of brain diseases and to design new drugs aimed at their treatment.

<p><strong></strong><strong>Simulations of Hydrogen Ingestion Flashes in Giant Stars</strong>; Paul Woodward (University of Minnesota, USA)</p>
<h3><strong><br /></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>My team at the University of Minnesota has been collaborating with the team of Falk Herwig at the University of Victoria to simulate brief events in the lives of stars that can greatly affect the heavy elements they synthesize in their interiors and subsequently expel into the interstellar medium. These events are caused by the ingestion of highly combustible hydrogen-rich fuel into the convection zone above a helium burning shell in the deeper interior. Although these events are brief, it can take millions of time steps to simulate the dynamics in sufficient detail to capture subtle aspects of the hydrogen ingestion. To address the computational challenge, we exploit modern multicore and many-core processors and also scale the simulations to run efficiently on over 13,000 nodes of NSF's Blue Waters machine at NCSA. Results of these simulations will be described along with some of the key numerical and computational techniques that make these simulations practical.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Short Biography</strong></p>
<p><em></em><em><em><em><em><em>Paul Woodward received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1973. He has focused his research on simulations of compressible flows in astrophysics, studying problems in star formation, supersonic jet propagation, convection in stars, and astrophysical turbulence.  He is a Fellow of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute and directs the Laboratory for Computational Science &amp; Engineering (LCSE) within the University of Minnesota's Digital Technology Center. The LCSE concentrates on high performance parallel computation and the data analysis and visualization that this requires. Woodward received the IEEE's Sidney Fernbach award in large-scale computing in 1995 and, with 12 collaborators at Livermore, Minnesota, and IBM, received the Gordon Bell prize in the performance category in 1999. His recent work combines simulation of convection, turbulence, and combustion in stellar interiors with the development of specialized techniques for exploiting the power of large networks of many-core computing devices.</em></em></em></em></em></p>

Abstract
The US, like the EU and other countries, is engaged in a national initiative that aims to deploy exascale computing platforms early in the next decade. The outlines of such platforms are starting to emerge. We shall survey, in our talk, the current roadmap for exascale computing and the main challenges this roadmap entails. We shall also discuss the likely evolution of HPC beyond exascale, in the "post-Moore" era.

Large Scale Computation in Seismic Exploration ; Dave Nichols (Schlumberger Limited, USA)
Abstract
Seismic exploration for oil and gas has been one of the largest commercial users of high performance computing for more than 50 years. We record petabyte datasets and use analysis and imaging techniques that require large-scale wave equation modelling. The problem size, and ambition level, of this modelling had increased regularly over the years. However, despite the many changes in computer architectures the methods used have been quite stable for at least 15 years. We have chosen to use explicit time-domain finite-difference methods on many different hardware platforms. I will discuss why this has been so successful and whether any current and future trends will require us to move to other computational methods.

Automatic Global Multiscale Seismic Inversion: Insights into Model, Data, and Workflow Management , Michael Afanasiev (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Christian Boehm (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Alexey Gokhberg (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Andreas Fichtner (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Modern global seismic waveform tomography is formulated as a PDE-constrained nonlinear optimization problem, where the optimization variables are Earth's visco-elastic parameters. This particular problem has several defining characteristics. First, the solution to the forward problem, which involves the numerical solution of the elastic wave equation over continental to global scales, is computationally expensive. Second, the determinedness of the inverse problem varies dramatically as a function of data coverage. This is chiefly due to the uneven distribution of earthquake sources and seismometers, which in turn results in an uneven sampling of the parameter space. Third, the seismic wavefield depends nonlinearly on the Earth's structure. Sections of a seismogram which are close in time may be sensitive to structure greatly separated in space. In addition to these theoretical difficulties, the seismic imaging community faces additional issues which are common across HPC applications. These include the storage of massive checkpoint files, the recovery from generic system failures, and the management of complex workflows, among others. While the community has access to solvers which can harness modern heterogeneous computing architectures, the computational bottleneck has fallen to these memory- and manpower-bounded issues. We present a two-tiered solution to the above problems. To deal with the problems relating to computational expense, data coverage, and the increasing nonlinearity of waveform tomography with scale, we present the Collaborative Seismic Earth Model (CSEM). This model, and its associated framework, takes an open-source approach to global-scale seismic inversion. Instead of attempting to monolithically invert all available seismic data, the CSEM approach focuses on the inversion of specific geographic subregions, and then consistently integrates these subregions via a common computational framework. To deal with the workflow and storage issues, we present a suite of workflow management software, along with a custom designed optimization and data compression library. It is the goal of this paper to synthesize these above concepts, originally developed in isolation, into components of an automatic global-scale seismic inversion.

We present a new open-source cosmological code, called SWIFT, designed to solve the equations of hydrodynamics using a particle-based approach (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) on hybrid shared / distributed-memory architectures. SWIFT was designed from the bottom up to provide excellent strong scaling on both commodity clusters (Tier-2 systems) and Top100-supercomputers (Tier-0 systems), without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized accelerator hardware. This performance is due to three main computational approaches: (i) Task-based parallelism for shared-memory parallelism, which provides fine-grained load balancing and thus strong scaling on large numbers of cores; (ii) Graph-based domain decomposition , which uses the task graph to decompose the simulation domain such that the work , as opposed to just the data , as is the case with most partitioning schemes, is equally distributed across all nodes; (iii) Fully dynamic and asynchronous communication , in which communication is modelled as just another task in the task-based scheme, sending data whenever it is ready and deferring on tasks that rely on data from other nodes until it arrives. In order to use these approaches, the code had to be re-written from scratch, and the algorithms therein adapted to the task-based paradigm. As a result, we can show upwards of 60% parallel efficiency for moderate-sized problems when increasing the number of cores 512-fold, on both x86-based and Power8-based architectures.

We summarize the optimization and performance evaluation of the Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) on two different types of supercomputers: the K computer and TSUBAME2.5. First, we evaluated and improved several kernels extracted from the model code on the K computer. We did not significantly change the loop and data ordering for sufficient usage of the features of the K computer, such as the hardware-aided thread barrier mechanism and the relatively high bandwidth of the memory, i.e., a 0.5 Byte/FLOP ratio. Loop optimizations and code cleaning for a reduction in memory transfer contributed to a speed-up of the model execution time. The sustained performance ratio of the main loop of the NICAM reached 0.87 PFLOPS with 81,920 nodes on the K computer. For GPU-based calculations, we applied OpenACC to the dynamical core of NICAM. The performance and scalability were evaluated using the TSUBAME2.5 supercomputer. We achieved good performance results, which showed efficient use of the memory throughput performance of the GPU as well as good weak scalability. A dry dynamical core experiment was carried out using 2560 GPUs, which achieved 60 TFLOPS of sustained performance.

The effective integration of models with data through Bayesian uncertainty quantification hinges on the formulation of a suitable likelihood function. In many cases such a likelihood may not be readily available or it may be difficult to compute. The Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) proposes the formulation of a likelihood function through the comparison between low dimensional summary statistics of the model predictions and corresponding statistics on the data. In this work we report a computationally efficient approach to the Bayesian updating of Molecular Dynamics (MD) models through ABC using a variant of the Subset Simulation method. We demonstrate that ABC can also be used for Bayesian updating of models with an explicitly defined likelihood function, and compare ABC-SubSim implementation and efficiency with the transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC). ABC-SubSim is then used in force-field identification of MD simulations. Furthermore, we examine the concept of relative entropy minimization for the calibration of force fields and exploit it within ABC. Using different approximate posterior formulations, we showcase that assuming Gaussian ensemble fluctuations of molecular systems quantities of interest can potentially lead to erroneous parameter identification.

Co-Authors: Eleuterio F. Toro (University of Trento, Italy); Gino I. Montecinos (Universidad de Chile, Chile); Raul Borsche (Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, Germany); Jochen Kall (Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, Germany)
We design a new implicit solver for the Junction-Generalized Riemann Problem (J-GRP), which is based on a recently proposed implicit method for solving the Generalized Riemann Problem (GRP) for systems of hyperbolic balance laws. We use the new J-GRP solver to construct an ADER scheme that is globally explicit, locally implicit and with no theoretical accuracy barrier, in both space and time. The resulting ADER scheme is able to deal with stiff source terms and can be applied to non-linear systems of hyperbolic balance laws in domains consisting on networks of one-dimensional sub-domains. Here we specifically apply the numerical techniques to networks of blood vessels. An application to a physical test problem consisting of a network of 37 compliant silicon tubes (arteries) and 21 junctions, reveals that it is imperative to use high-order methods at junctions, in order to preserve the desired high-order of accuracy in the full computational domain.

Accurate characterization of the cardiac activation sequence can support diagnosis and personalized therapy in heart-failure patients. Current invasive mapping techniques provide limited coverage. Our aim is to estimate a complete volumetric activation map from a limited number of measurements. This is achieved by optimising the local conductivity and early activation sites to minimise the mismatch between simulated and measured activation times. We modeled the activation times using an eikonal equation, reducing computational cost by 3 orders of magnitude compared to more physiologically detailed methods. The model provided a sufficiently accurate approximation of the activation time and the ECG in our patients. The solver was implemented on GPUs. Since the fast-marching method is not suitable for this architecture, we used a simple Jacobi iteration of a local variational principle. On a single GPU, each forward simulation took less than 2 seconds, and the inverse problem was solved in a few minutes.

The ever-increasing available computational power allows for solving more complex physical problems spanning multiple physical domains. We present a numerical tool for simulating fluid-structure interaction between blood flow and the soft tissue of heart valves. Using the basic concept of the Immersed Boundary Method, the interaction between the two physical domains (flow and structure) does not require mesh manipulation. We solve the governing equations of the fluid and the structure with domain-specific finite difference and finite element discretisations, respectively. We use a massively parallel algorithmic framework for handling the L2-projection transfer between the loosely coupled highly parallel solvers for fluid and solid. Our tool builds on a well-established and proven Navier-Stokes solver and a novel method for solving non-linear continuum solid mechanics.

Simulation of Fluid-Structure Interaction with a Thick Structure via an Extended Finite Element Approach ; Stefano Zonca (Politecnico di Milano, Italy)
Co-Authors: Luca Formaggia (Politecnico di Milano, Italy); Christian Vergara (Politecnico di Milano, Italy)
In this talk, we present an eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) to simulate the fluid-structure interaction arising from a 3D flexible thick structure immersed in a fluid. Both fluid and solid domains are discretized independently by generating two overlapped unstructured meshes. Due to the unfitted nature of the considered meshes, this method avoids the technical problems related to an ALE approach while maintaining an accurate description of the fluid-structure interface. The coupling between the fluid and solid is taken into account by means of a Discontinuous Galerkin approach, which allows to impose the interface conditions. A possible application is the study of the interaction arising between blood and aortic valve leaflets since it is important for understanding its functional behaviour, for developing prosthetic valve devices and for post-surgery feedbacks.

Direct Numerical Simulation of Transitional Hydrodynamics of the Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chiari I Malformation ; Kartik Jain (University of Siegen, Germany)
Co-Authors: Kent-Andre Mardal (University of Oslo, Norway)
Chiari malformation type I is a disorder characterized by the herniation of cerebellar tonsils into the spinal canal resulting in obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow. The flow of oscillating CSF is acutely complex due to the anatomy of the subarachnoid space. We report first ever direct numerical simulations on patient specific cases with resolutions that border Kolmogorov scales, amounting to meshes with 2 billion cells and conducted on 50,000 cores of the Hazelhen supercomputer in Stuttgart. Results depict velocity fluctuations of 10kHz, turbulent kinetic energy 2x of mean flow energy in Chiari patients while the flow remains laminar in control subject. The fluctuations confine near craniovertebral junction, and are commensurate with the extremeness of pathology and the extent of herniation. The results advocate that the manifestation of pathological conditions like Chiari malformation may lead to transitional CSF, and a prudent calibration of numerics is necessary to capture such phenomena.
Advanced Computational Methods for Applications to the Cardiovascular System I
Cardiac and Cardiovascular Mathematics represents nowadays a challenging topic in view of the emerging and growing collaborations between clinicians and mathematicians. In this respect, the numerical solution of problems arising in modelling cardiac and systemic phenomena opens new and interesting perspectives which need to be properly addressed. From the cardiac side, a fully integrated heart model represents a complex multiphysics problem, which is in turn composed of several submodels describing cardiac electrophysiology, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. On the system circulation side, although it has been studied for a longer time, several mathematical and numerical aspects still need to be addressed (e.g., tissue remodelling, atherosclerotic plaque formation, aneurysms development, transitional and turbulence phenomena in blood flows). This minisymposium aims at gathering researchers and experts in computational and numerical modelling of the heart and the systemic circulation.

Co-Authors:
For a few years, we have been developing in Strasbourg new cosmological simulation tools to study the reionization process. These tools participate to the strong ongoing effort by the community to include the radiative transfer physics in numerical simulations. Given its central role in the transition, one might want to deal routinely with light in the same way as we deal with matter in such codes. However, the inclusion of light is known to be quite challenging in terms of numerical resources and can increase by orders of magnitude the complexity or the numerical requirements of the existing codes. I will present how we were led to use graphics processing units (GPUs) as hardware accelerators to cope with this numerical challenge and I will discuss the methodologies of ATON, a radiative post-processing code and EMMA, a new complete AMR cosmological simulation code, both accelerated by means of graphics devices.

Co-Authors:
Particle-in-Cell (PIC) codes will be among the first applications to run at the exascale due to their high scalability and excellent data locality. This is especially true for relativistic PIC codes that simulate very fast phenomena where fields are time-advanced along with the particles. However, the time scale covered by these simulations is extremely short and of limited usefulness for magnetic fusion research. The gyrokinetic approximation of the Valsov equation, on the other hand, allows for much larger time scales by mathematically integrating out the fast cyclotron motion of ions in magnetized plasmas. Global gyrokinetic PIC codes, which implement this method, have been very successful but also more challenging to scale than their "classical" counterparts due to the gyrokinetic formulation and the need to solve a Poisson equation. This talk describes several computational schemes that have allowed the GK-PIC codes to overcome some of these issues and scale to petascale.

We present the open-source ecosystem around the reportedly fastest particle-in-cell code in the world (sustained Flop/s), PIConGPU. Designed for modern clusters powered by manycore hardware, we motivate that HPC plasma simulations should be able to estimate their systematic and random error (e.g., by varying solvers and initial conditions). Our approach starts with an open-source, anytime fork-able development cycle as the basis for scrutable and reproducible simulations. To promote interoperability, we develop and propagate an open, self-describing, file-format agnostic data-markup (openPMD) that is suitable for extreme I/O load and in-situ processing, demonstrated in a live simulation. PIConGPU is build on top of C++ meta-programming libraries, providing single-source kernel acceleration (alpaka) to work asynchronously on distributed data containers (PMacc). Using compile-time optimisation techniques, we show that particle-mesh methods can be implemented for arbitrary high-performance hardware (GPGPUs, CPUs, OpenPOWER, Xeon Phi) featuring solver agility without negative implications on maintenance (rewrite) or runtime performance.

With the aim of porting Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes to modern parallel computers equipped with coprocessors, we have designed a testbed called PIC_ENGINE retaining the key elements of the PIC algorithm as applied to plasma physics simulations. A hybrid OpenMP/MPI implementation is used to explore the potential gain in performance on multi-core CPUs and Many Integrated Core (MIC) coprocessors. A bucket sort is added to increase data locality and a vectorization algorithm is implemented showing an improvement in the overall performance. With the PIC_ENGINE, we show that the hybrid OpenMP/MPI approach allows a performance gain of approximately 60% compared to pure MPI. Furthermore, the sorting and vectorization increase the performance of the most time consuming methods by up to a factor 3.2. Finally, using the same code, hybrid runs are performed on MIC and show similar conclusions. However, due to inefficient vectorization, the overall performance is poor compared to CPU runs.

Refactoring large legacy codes to exploit the power of new multithreaded devices is not an easy task. For this purpose, we designed a platform embedding simplified basic features of PIC codes. It solves the drift-kinetic equations (first step towards gyrokinetics) in a sheared plasma slab using B-spline finite elements up to fourth order. Multiple levels of parallelism have been implemented using MPI+OpenMP and MPI+OpenACC. It has been shown that sorting particles can lead to performance improvement by increasing data locality and vectorizing the grid memory access. This paper focuses on GPU implementation, which overtakes CPU timing by up to a factor 4 while not requiring a big code rewriting effort. This gain increases with the splines order. Weak and strong scalability tests have been successfully run on GPU-equipped Cray XC30 Piz Daint (CSCS) up to 4,096 nodes. Those performances shall enable advanced studies of turbulent transport in magnetic fusion devices.

Tracking and identification of particles are amongst the most time-critical tasks in the computing farms of high-energy physics experiments. Many of the underlying algorithms were designed before the advent of multi-core processors and are therefore strictly serial. Since the introduction of multi-core platforms these workloads have been parallelized by executing multiple copies of the application. This approach does not optimally utilize modern hardware. We present two different thread-parallel implementations of a straight-line particle track finding algorithm. We compare our implementations, based on TBB and OpenMP, to the current production version in LHCb's Gaudi software framework as well as a state-of-the-art implementation for general purpose GPUs. Our initial analysis shows a speedup of more than 50% over multi-process Gaudi runs and competitive performance to the GPGPU version. This study allows us to better understand the impact of many-core hardware platforms supplementing traditional CPUs in the context of the upcoming LHCb upgrade.
Advanced Computing in Plasma, Particle and Astrophysics on Emerging HPC Architectures
Non-traditional computing architectures such as general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) and many-integrated core accelerators are providing leading edge performance for advanced scientific computing. Their advantages are particularly evident when the power cost is considered: The top 10 "green500", where flops/watt is the ranking criteria, are all heterogeneous machines. Given that power costs are becoming more critical, future capability machines are likely to be dominated by these architectures. Non-traditional architectures may require non-traditional programming models, and the scientific community is still learning how to take full advantage of heterogeneous machines with reasonable programming effort. This difficulty is compounded by the need for sophisticated algorithms to handle the large dynamic ranges encountered in state-of-the-art physics and astrophysics simulations. This minisymposium provides a forum for researchers in the computational plasma, particle physics and astrophysics communities to share their techniques and findings. The presentation and discussion of findings and lessons learned will foment more effective use of these new resources for the advancement of physics and astrophysics.

The complexity inherent in the application of advanced numerics on modern hardware to coupled physical systems presents a critical barrier to simulation development. To overcome this, we must create simulation software which embodies the abstraction and composability of the underlying mathematics. In this way, a system is created in which mathematicians, computer scientists, and application specialists can each deploy their own expertise, benefiting from the expertise of the others. Critically, this approach minimises the extent to which individuals must become polymaths to share in these advances. In this talk I will present Firedrake and PyOP2, a composition of new and existing abstractions which creates a particularly complete separation of concerns. This enables the creation of high performance, sophisticated finite element models from a very high level mathematical specification and has enabled advances in computer science and numerics, while also facilitating the creation of simulation systems for a variety of applications.

The fast-paced environment of high-performance computing architectures has always been a challenge for complex codes. First, the effort to adapt the code to new processor architectures is significant compared to their typical release phase. Second, optimisations for one target often incur performance penalties on others. Third, such codes are generally developed by domain scientists, which typically lack the expertise about specific details of the target platform. Successful projects like STELLA have shown that a way out of this situation is to apply the concept of separation of concerns. GridTools is pushing this concept even further: The domain scientist's work is conducted within a prototyping environment using a domain-specific language (DSL), while the computer scientist profiles the automatically-generated code over diverse architectures, implemented by different hardware-specific backends. This talk will give an overview of the GridTools ecosystem, highlighting the use of the prototyping environment in combination with the automatic-code generation engine.

We have been developing a compiler of PGAS programming language called XcalableMP for post-petascale computing. XcalableMP is a directive-based language extension of Fortran95 and C for scientific programming for high-performance distributed memory parallel systems. Omni Compiler is an infrastructure for source-to-source transformation to design source-to-source compilers such as Omni XcalableMP compiler. It includes C and Fortran95 front-ends which translate a source code to XML-based intermediate code called XcodeML, a Java-based code-transformation library on XcodeML, and the de-compilers which translate XcodeML intermediate code back to transformed source code. Currently, the Omni compiler also supports the code transformation for OpenMP and OpenACC. In this talk, we will present internals of Omni compiler by taking Omni XcalableMP compiler as a case study, and our future plan.

The need for portable efficient climate applications arise from the demand on precise climate and weather modelling. Model codes are growing in complexity and it is difficult to achieve consensus to deliver both high performance with high programmer productivity. GridTools is a C++ template library for applications on regular grids. The user is required to specify the high-level application model and provide the stencil-operators while the library provides optimised backend for underlying computational hardware. This helps to detach model developer from implementation details. Production process becomes more straightforward with early deployment to HPC clusters. Solution of tridiagonal linear systems, typical for implicit schemes such as advection, diffusion and radiation is abundant and performance critical in climate models. We use GridTools library to implement Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Krylov solver, iterative method efficient for solving sparse linear systems. We evaluate performance and compare it to other tools such as PETSc.

The ExaHyPE project employs the high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method in order to solve hyperbolic PDEs on adaptive Cartesian grids at exascale level. Envisaged applications include grand-challenge simulations in astrophysics and geosciences. Our compute kernels rely on tensor operations - a type of operation scientific computing libraries only support to a limited degree. We demonstrate concepts of how the tensor operations can be reduced to dense matrix-matrix multiplications, which is undoubtedly one of the best optimised operations in linear algebra. We apply reordering and reshaping techniques, which enables our code generator to exploit existing highly optimised libraries as back end and produce highly optimised compute kernels. As a result, our tool chain provides a "complete solution" for tensor product-based FEM 'operations'.

As new hybrid HPC architectures are being more common, scientific applications are being adapted to take advantage of these new computing power. Programming standards like OpenACC have been successfully applied to allow parallelism in existing code to be offloaded efficiently on accelerators. Achieving optimal performance on various architectures with a single source code is not always possible. Restructuring the code and applying specific architecture optimisation is often needed to increase the performance. This situation has been observed while porting the COSMO weather model, as well as the CAM-SE model to an Hybrid CPU/GPU architecture. In order to help the code transformation and keep a single source code efficient on multiple architectures, we are developing a directive language as well as a tool named CLAW that allow the developer to specify and apply the necessary code transformations to generate both optimal GPU and CPU code from a single Fortran source code.
Code Generation Techniques for HPC Earth Science Applications
Earth Science simulations share key characteristics: There is a constant drive to higher resolutions while simultaneously incorporating ever-more sophisticated descriptions of the underlying physical processes. This trend results in a dramatic increase in the computational requirements. To support this trend, more sophisticated numerical techniques are required along with a drastic increase in computing power from emerging architectures, such as clusters of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Both aspects of this duality imply increased programming complexity. The difficulty does not stop there, the useful life of Earth Science applications should span several generations of hardware technology, and, moreover, new software development often extends existing legacy Fortran or C++ code. These challenges are now usually addressed by adding onto existing code: its size increases with the algorithmic complexity and new physical descriptions, parallelism is incorporated by using message-passing and/or multithreading libraries, such as MPI or pthreads, or by essentially extending the language with parallelization directives, such as OpenMP for CPUs or Intel Xeon Phi or OpenACC for GPUs. Codes targeting multiple architectures either have multiple implementations, or use extensive pre-processing macros controlled by compilation flags. The domain scientist usually has to manage multiple disciplines, including numerical analysis and high performance programming. The resulting code becomes unreadable for anyone but the developer, meaning that software maintenance is intractable. Drawing on evidence from a wide spectrum of Earth Science applications, we feel it is intuitive that new tools describing numerics and parallelism at a high level of abstraction are needed to meet these challenges of increasing complexity. This minisymposium covers a spectrum of code generation approaches. Their over-arching goal is to separate the concerns of domain science, underlying numerical techniques and high performance computing (i.e., Computer Science), so that specialists can put their expertise to best use. We consider software frameworks, such as FireDrake and FEniCS, for the high-level specification of partial differential equations, which can generate code optimized for parallel CPU and GPU clusters. Such problem-solving frameworks are valuable for the scientist without HPC background who would like to formulate a numerical solution, which then runs optimally on a target architecture. Next, libraries for stencil calculations, such as GridTools, can help the developer isolate computation intensive kernels, which can be written in a high-level hardware-oblivious fashion making use of C++ template meta-programming. For pre-existing applications written in other languages, such as Fortran, GridTools offers an interfacing layer to take care of data management. Moreover, a Python environment is presented that can generate GridTools-compliant kernels. Source-to-source compilers, such as Omni, allow for translation of code, and can be used for domain specific extensions of existing languages, such as in the CLAW project. Finally, several use cases and numerical examples, such as the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver or the discontinuous Galerkin method, are present to illustrate the usability of these new tools.

This talk outlines strategies to advance the scalability of electronic structure algorithms intended for all-electron electronic structure theory. In the context of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, the key scalability bottleneck is the eigenvalue problem, addressed by the ELPA eigenvalue solver library and a new, broader "Electronic Structure Infrastructure" (ELSI) interface to scalable but general approaches to construct directly the density matrix with reduced prefactors and/or scaling exponents. We also address a scalable, localized resolution of identity based implementation of hybrid functionals that offers O(N) scalability for calculations of approximately 1,000 atoms system size. Finally, we show first steps towards a load-balanced CPU-GPU all-electron electronic structure implementation in the framework of the FHI-aims all-electron code.

Co-Authors:
With HPC advances of recent years, ab initio techniques are becoming the standard tool for studying and predicting many materials properties. To be effective, it is necessary to have software particularly well suited to the hardware as well as a strong interaction with the ab initio application to optimise the amount of data produced and the execution time. In this talk, I will discuss the recent developments done in ABINIT in order to pave the way towards exascale computation and the python framework we are developing to automate and optimise large workflows on HPC architectures.

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a widely used electronic structure code. The release version is parallelized using MPI and runs efficiently on current HPC hardware all over the world. The next generation of HPC hardware, however, will be quite different from the current (Xeon-like) hardware: in all probability it will consist either of GPU accelerated nodes or MIC nodes (e.g. Intel's upcoming Knights Landing processors). In my talk I'll describe the work we have been doing to get VASP ready to run efficiently on these new HPC architectures.

Since 2008, the BigDFT project consortium has developed an ab initio DFT code based on Daubechies wavelets. In recent articles, we presented the linear scaling version of BigDFT code[1], where a minimal set of localized support functions is optimised in situ for systems in various boundary conditions. We will present how the flexibility of this approach is helpful in providing a basis set that is optimally tuned to the chemical environment surrounding each atom. In addition than providing a basis useful to project Kohn-Sham orbitals informations like atomic charges and partial density of states, it can also be reused as-is, without re-optimisation, for charge-constrained DFT calculations within a fragment approach[2]. We will demonstrate the interest of this approach to express highly precise and efficient calculations of systems in complex environments[3].

Sizing Up Linear-Scaling DFT: Recent Applications of ONETEP to Carbon Nanostructures ; Arash Mostofi (Imperial College London, United Kingdom)
Co-Authors:
Over the past twenty years, electronic structure calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT) have revolutionized the way in which materials are studied. Advances in computer power have clearly played a major role, but as important has been the development of new methods that (i) enhance the scale and the scope of such calculations and (ii) keep up with current trends in high-performance computing hardware. In this talk, I will outline some aspects of the development of the ONETEP [1] linear-scaling DFT code that enables accurate calculations on tens of thousands of atoms on modern architectures. Such simulations give rise to both opportunities and challenges, which I will try to highlight. I will then focus on a specific example of the application of ONETEP to a problem that is rather challenging for conventional cubic-scaling DFT due to the large system sizes involved, namely electron transport in carbon nanotube networks.

First-Principles Simulations on Modern and Novel Architectures
The predictive power of the so-called ab initio methods, based on the fundamental quantum-mechanical models of matter at the atomic level, together with the growing computational power of high-end High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, have led to exciting scientific and technological results in Materials Science. The increase of computational power coupled with better numerical techniques open up the possibility to simulate and predict the behaviour of larger and larger atomic systems with a higher degree of accuracy, shortening the path from theoretical results to technological applications, and opening up the possibility to design new materials from scratch. Despite the elegant simplicity of the formulation of the basic quantum mechanical principles, a practical implementation of a many-particle simulation has to use some approximations and models to be feasible. As there are several options for these approximations, different ab initio simulation codes have been developed, with different trade-offs between precision and computational effort. Each of these codes has its specific strengths and weaknesses, but all together have contributed to making computational materials science one of the domains where supercomputers raise the efficiency of producing scientific know-how and technological innovation. Indeed, a large fraction of the available workload in supercomputers around the world is spent to perform Computational Materials Science simulations. These codes have mostly kept pace with hardware improvements over the years, by relying on proven libraries and paradigms, such as MPI, that could abstract the developers from low-level considerations while the architectures evolved within a nearly homogeneous model. In the past few years, however, the emergence of heterogeneous computing elements associated with the transition from peta- to exascale has started to evidence the fragility of this model of development. The aim of the present minisymposium is to gather expert developers from different codes to discuss the challenges of porting, scaling, and optimizing material science application codes for modern and novel platforms. The presentations will focus on advanced programming paradigms, novel algorithms, domain specific libraries, in-memory data management, and software/hardware co-design. Exascale related challenges (such as sustained performance, energy awareness, code fault tolerance, task concurrency and load balancing, numerical noise and stability, big data I/O) will also be discussed.

Co-Authors:
Capsules consist of an internal medium enclosed by a semi-permeable membrane which protects it and controls its exchanges with the environment. Capsules exist in nature under the form of cells or eggs; artificial microcapsules are widely used in industry to protect active substances, aromas or flavors and control their targeted release. In most situations, capsules are suspended into another flowing liquid and are subjected to hydrodynamic forces. One robust method to model the three-dimensional fluid-structure interactions consists in coupling a boundary integral method (for the internal and external fluid motion) with a finite element method (for the membrane deformation), which we have shown to be stable and accurate. We will review how numerical models have provided insights into the dynamics of an ellipsoidal capsule in simple shear flow. We will determine which regimes are mechanically stable and correlate the results with experimental studies on artificial capsules and red blood cells.

The prediction of conversion efficiency and pollutant emissions in combustion devices is particularly challenging as they result from very complex interactions of turbulence, chemistry, and heat exchanges at very different space and time scales. In the recent years, Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) has proven to bring significant improvements in the prediction of reacting turbulent flows. The CORIA lab leads the development of the YALES2 solver, which is designed to model turbulent reactive two-phase flows with body-fitted unstructured meshes. It has been specifically tailored for dealing with very large meshes up to tens of billion cells and for solving efficiently the low-Mach number Navier-Stokes equations on massively parallel computers. The presentation will focus on the high-fidelity combustion LES and the analysis of the huge amount of data generated by these simulations. Numerical methods used to decouple the different time-scales and to optimise the mesh resolution will also be emphasized.

We discuss recent developments in the Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) methods, such as the height function method for the approximation of the geometry of the interface, the balanced-force surface tension method, and the methods that conserve mass and momentum at machine accuracy. Applications at high Reynolds number, such as high speed liquid-gas flows, and low Reynolds and low Capillary numbers, are discussed. Problems of engineering and physical interest, such as jet atomisation or flow in porous media are investigated with these methods as will be shown.

The AFiD code, an open source solver for the Navier-Stokes equations (www.afid.eu), has been ported to GPU clusters to tackle large-scale wall bounded turbulent flow simulations. The GPU port has been carried out in CUDA Fortran with the extensive use of kernel loop directives (CUF kernels) in order to have a source code as close as possible to the original CPU version. Just few routines have been manually written. On Piz-Daint (CSCS), the current GPU version can solve a 2048x3072x3072 mesh on 640 K20x GPUs in 2.4s per time step, while with 2048 GPUs, we measured 0.89s per time step. Thanks to the increased performance and efficient use of memory, this tool allows for simulations in a range parameter that is unprecedented in Rayleigh-Benard convection.

Performance prediction based on numerical simulations can be very helpful in the design process of hydraulic turbines. The Finite Volume Particle Method (FVPM) is a consistent and conservative particle-based method which inherits interesting features of both Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and grid-based Finite Volume Method. This method is particularly well-suited for such simulations thanks to its versatility. SPHEROS is a parallel FVPM solver which has been developed at the EPFL - Laboratory for Hydraulic Machines for simulating Pelton turbines and silt erosion. In order to allow the simulation of industrial-size setups, a GPU version of SPHEROS (GPU-SPHEROS) is being developed in CUDA and features Thrust library to handle complicated structures such as octree. Besides, some highly-optimised kernels are also implemented for both compute-bound and memory-bound algorithms. Comparing the performance of different parts of GPU-SPHEROS and SPHEROS, we achieve a speed-up factor of at least eight.
High-Performance Computing in Fluid Mechanics I
Large-scale computer simulations have become an indispensable tool in fluid dynamics research. Elucidating the fundamental flow physics or designing and optimizing flows for applications ranging all the way from low Reynolds number multiphase flows at small length scales to fully developed turbulence at large scales requires state-of-the art simulation capabilities. The need for large-scale HPC simulations in fluids dynamics has therefore been driving the development of novel simulation algorithms and of optimized software infrastructure. The envisioned PASC 16 symposium will bring together both developers and users of modern simulation tools. The set of talks will showcase a wide range of fields in which HPC computations are essential, highlight recent advances in computational methods and provide a platform to identify challenges and opportunities for future research.

Co-Authors:
Studying complex physical phenomena requires integrating the heterogeneous computational models of the different subsystems to analyse the interactions between the aspects that characterize the phenomenon as a whole. While efficient methods are available to build and simulate single models, the problem of devising a general approach to integrate heterogeneous models has been studied only recently and is still an open issue. We propose an engineering methodology to automate the process of integrating heterogeneous computational models. The methodology is based on the novel idea of capturing the relevant information about the different models and their integration strategies by means of meta-data that can be used to automatically generate an efficient integration framework for the specific set of models and interactions. We discuss the various aspects of the integration problem, highlight the limits of the current solutions and characterize the novel methodology by means of a concrete case study.

Abstractions for PDEs ; Magne Haveraaen (University of Bergen, Norway)
Co-Authors:
The dominant abstraction in partial differential equations (PDEs) solvers is the array. From a computational viewpoint this makes sense: the representation theorem of PDEs ensures that any data component can be represented as an array. From a software engineering viewpoint this is not so clearcut. At the higher abstraction level, the array abstraction is not aligned with the concepts of the PDE domain. The effect is a lack of composition and reuse properties, manifest in the need to redevelop code from scratch when equations or assumptions change in unanticipated ways. At the lower level, the array abstraction is tied to a single core, uniform access memory model. The newer PGAS (partitioned global address space) model handles symmetric multicore architectures, but falls short of heterogeneous hardware (GPU, FPGA). The presentation will exemplify some of these problems, and sketch some solutions in the form of more appropriate abstractions.

A Literate Process for Improving the Quality of Scientific Computing Software ; Spencer Smith (McMaster University, Canada)
Co-Authors:
Scientific Computing (SC) software sometimes suffers with respect to the qualities of reusability, maintainability, verifiability and reproducibility because of a lack of documentation. A potential solution is to generalize the idea of Literate Programming. Our proposed Literate Process will not only generate program documentation and code from the source files, but also other software artifacts, such as the requirements specification, design documentation, and test reports. Documentation quality will improve because a generator removes the drudgery and errors associated with information duplication and traceability. Using Haskell we have developed a prototype tool, named Drasil, to support this process. The fundamental task for Drasil is managing knowledge through what are termed chunks. A recipe is used to put the chunks together and a generator then interprets the recipes to produce the desired documentation. An example will be shown for software that simulates the temperature in a solar water heating tank.

Co-Authors:
The rapid development of novel HPC software represents a formidable challenge at the present time. Computing hardware is evolving at a faster-than-ever pace, the timely software development for these platforms requires exceptionally high productivity. Developers are often exposed to high-risks design decisions that might irreversibly compromise the software performance on the target platform. In this talk we discuss an approach that attempts to address these issues while identifying its associated costs.
Software Engineering Meets Scientific Computing: Generality, Reusability and Performance for Scientific Software Platforms I: Engineering Methodologies and Development Processes
Software platforms for modelling and simulation of scientific problems are becoming increasingly important in many fields and often drive the scientific discovery process. These platforms present unique requirements in terms of functionalities, performance and scalability, which limit the applicability of consolidated software engineering practices for their design, implementation and validation. For instance, since the effectiveness of a software platform for scientific simulation strictly depends on the level of performance and scalability it can achieve, the design, development and optimization of the platform are usually tailored to the specific hardware architecture the platform is expected to run on. Similarly, when a scientific simulation requires the integration of multiple software platforms, such integration is typically customized for the specific simulation problem at hand. Because of this, developing and integrating scientific computing platforms demands for a significant amount of relevant knowledge about the modeled domain and the software and hardware infrastructures used for simulation. This information typically remains hidden in the implementation details of a specific solution and cannot be easily reused to port the simulation to different hardware infrastructures or to implement or integrate different simulation platforms on the same hardware infrastructure. The Software Engineering for Scientific Computing (SESC) minisymposium is concerned with identifying suitable engineering processes to design, develop, integrate and validate software platforms for scientific modelling and simulations. This introduces challenges that require the expertise of researchers working in different areas, including computational scientists to model scientific problems, software engineers to propose engineering methodology and HPC experts to analyze platform dependent performance requirements that characterize simulations. The goal of the SESC minisymposium is to bring together software engineers, computational scientists and HPC experts to discuss and advance the engineering practices to implement platforms for scientific computing, aiming to reduce the development time, increase the reusability, the maintainability and the testability of the platforms, while offering the level of performance and scalability that is required by the simulation scenarios at hand. Specifically, the Software Engineering for Scientific Computing (SESC) minisymposium aims to address two conflicting requirements in the definition of an effective software development process: 1) promoting generality and reusability of software components, to simplify maintenance, evolution, adaptation and porting of software platforms 2) defining solution that guarantee an adequate level of performance and scalability, which is of paramount importance in scientific simulations. The SESC minisymposium is organized around two sessions: this first session focuses more specifically on design methodologies and development processes for general and reusable code; the second session (Part 2) targets the requirements of performance and scalability in scientific software platforms.

Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) frequently arise in continuum descriptions of physical processes relevant to science and engineering. Multilevel preconditioners represent a family of scalable techniques for solving discrete PDEs of this type and thus are the method of choice for highresolution simulations. The scalability and time-to-solution of massively parallel multilevel preconditioners can be adversely affected by using a coarse-level solver with sub-optimal algorithmic complexity. To maintain scalability, agglomeration techniques applied to the coarse level have been shown to be necessary. In this work, we present a new software component introduced within the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation (PETSc) which permits agglomeration. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of this functionality, together with several use cases highlighting the benefits of agglomeration. Lastly, we demonstrate via numerical experiments employing geometric multigrid with structured meshes, the flexibility and performance gains possible using our MPI-rank agglomeration implementation.

Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) methods have proven to be powerful preconditioners for large and sparse linear systems arising from the ﬁnite element discretization of elliptic PDEs. Condition number bounds can be theoretically established that are independent of the number of subdomains of the decomposition. The core of the methods resides in the design of a larger and partially discontinuous ﬁnite element space that allows for fast application of the preconditioner, where Cholesky factorizations of the subdomain ﬁnite element problems are additively combined with a coarse, global solver. Multilevel and highly-scalable algorithms can be obtained by replacing the coarse Cholesky solver with a coarse BDDC preconditioner. BDDC methods have the remarkable ability to control the condition number, since the coarse space of the preconditioner can be adaptively enriched at the cost of solving local eigenproblems. The proper identiﬁcation of these eigenproblems extends the robustness of the methods to any heterogeneity in the distribution of the coefficients of the PDEs, not only when the coefficients jumps align with the sub-domain boundaries or when the high contrast regions are conﬁned to lie in the interior of the subdomains. The specific adaptive technique considered in this paper does not depend upon any interaction of discretization and partition; it relies purely on algebraic operations. Coarse space adaptation in BDDC methods has attractive algorithmic properties, since the technique enhances the concurrency and the arithmetic intensity of the preconditioning step of the sparse implicit solver with the aim of controlling the number of iterations of the Krylov method in a black-box fashion, thus reducing the number of global synchronization steps needed by the iterative solver; data movement and memory bound kernels in the solve phase can be thus limited at the expense of extra local ﬂops during the setup of the preconditioner. This paper presents an exposition of the BDDC algorithm that identiﬁes the current computational bottlenecks that could prevent it from being competitive with other solvers, and proposes solutions in anticipation of exascale architectures. Furthermore, the discussion aims to give interested practitioners sufficient insights to decide whether or not to pursue BDDC in their applications. In addition, the work presents novel numerical results using the distributed memory implementation of BDDC in the PETSc library for vector ﬁeld problems arising in the context of porous media ﬂows and electromagnetic modeling; the results provide evidence of the robustness of these methods for highly heterogenous problems and non-conforming discretizations.

This paper describes the Hybrid Total FETI (HTFETI) method and its parallel implementation in the ESPRESO library. HTFETI is a variant of the FETI type domain decomposition method in which a small number of neighboring subdomains is aggregated into clusters. This can be also viewed as a multilevel decomposition approach which results into a smaller coarse problem - the main scalability bottleneck of the FETI and FETI-DP methods. The efficiency of our implementation which employs hybrid parallelization in the form of MPI and Cilk++ is evaluated using both weak and strong scalability tests. The weak scalability of the solver is shown on the 3 dimensional linear elasticity problem of a size up to 30 billion of Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) executed on 4096 compute nodes. The strong scalability is evaluated on the problem of size 2.6 billion DOF scaled from 1000 to 4913 compute nodes. The results show the super-linear scaling of the single iteration time and linear scalability of the solver runtime. The latter combines both numerical and parallel scalability and shows overall HTFETI solver performance. The large scale tests use our own parallel synthetics benchmark generator that is also described in the paper. The last set of results shows that HTFETI is very efficient for problems of size up 1.7 billion DOF and provide better time to solution when compared to TFETI method.

The solver is based on a finite volume scheme for structured grids and advances the solution using an explicit Runge-Kutta time stepper. The numerical scheme requires the computation of the flux divergence based on an approximate Riemann problem. The computation of the divergence quantity is the most expensive task in the algorithm. Our implementation takes advantage of the compute capabilities of heterogeneous CPU/GPU architectures. The computational problem is organized in subdomains small enough to be placed into the GPU memory. The compute intensive stencil scheme is offloaded to the GPU accelerator while advancing the solution in time on the CPU. Our method to implement the stencil scheme on the GPU is not limited to applications in fluid dynamics. The performance of our solver was assessed on Piz Daint, a XC30 supercomputer at CSCS. The GPU code is memory-bound and achieves a per-node performance of 462 Gflop/s, outperforming by 3.2x the multicore-based Gordon Bell winning CUBISM-MPCF solver for the offloaded computation on the same platform. The focus of this work is on the per-node performance of the heterogeneous solver. In addition, we examine the performance of the solver across 4096 compute nodes. We present simulations for the shock-induced collapse of an aligned row of air bubbles submerged in water using 4 billion cells. Results show a final pressure amplification that is 100x stronger than the strength of the initial shock.

Cardiac electrophysiology simulations are numerically extremely challenging, due to the propagation of the very steep electrochemical wave front during depolarization. Hence, in classical continuous Galerkin (CG) approaches, very small temporal and spacial discretisations are necessary to obtain physiological propagation. Until now, spatial discretisations based on discontinuous methods have received little attention for cardiac electrophysiology simulations. In particular, local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) or hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods have not been explored yet. Application of such methods, when taking advantage of their parallelity features, would allow a speed-up of the computations. In this work we provide a detailed comparison among CG, LDG and HDG methods for electrophysiology equations based on the mono-domain model. We also study the effect of the numerical integration of the non-linear ionic current term. Furthermore we plan to show the difference between classic CG methods and HDG methods on large three-dimensional simulations with patient-specific cardiac geometries.

Fluid Structure Interaction Model for Heart Assist Device Optimization Studies ; Thomas Kummer (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
Designing and optimising heart assist devices is complicated by a lack of parameter data and limited experimental capabilities. Thus, computational models can step in to gain a better understanding of the fluid and structure mechanics of the heart. We have developed a structural model of the heart muscle, which is coupled to a lumped parameter blood circulation. Doing this, we only focus on relevant processes for the design of heart assist devices acting on the heart's outer surface and therefore reduce computational effort. In a first step we want to show the influence of deploying force on the pericardium and to what extent the heart's contraction can be supported. In a second step force patches will be optimised toward objectives like cardiac output, contraction pattern or stress inside the heart muscle. The knowledge of how to distribute force on the heart's surface will be fundamental to the assist device design.

Co-Authors: Luca Dede' (EPFL, Switzerland); Davide Forti (EPFL, Switzerland); Alfio Quarteroni (EPFL, Switzerland)
In this talk, we focus on the coupling of electrophysiology and mechanical models to realize an integrated model of the left ventricle by considering the active contraction of the muscle and the feedback on the electrophysiology. For the latter, we consider the mono-domain equations with the Bueno-Orovio ionic model. As for the mechanics, we consider the Holzapfl-Ogden model together with an active strain approach with a transmurally variable activation parameter. We spatially approximate the model by means of the Finite Element method and discuss the properties of different coupling strategies and time discretization schemes. Among these, we consider a fully coupled strategy with a semi-implicit scheme for the time discretization. In order to solve the linear system arising from such discretization, we use a preconditioner based on the FaCSI (Factorized Condensed SIMPLE) concept. We present and discuss numerical results obtained in the HPC framework, including patient-specific left ventricle geometries.

Coronary artery disease, caused by the build-up of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary vessel walls, is one of the leading causes of death in the world. For high-risk patients, coronary artery bypass graft is the preferred treatment. Despite overall excellent patency rates, bypasses may fail due to restenosis. In this context, we present a computational study of the fluid-dynamics in patient-specific geometries with the aim of investigating a possible relationship between coronary stenosis and graft failure. Firstly, we propose a strategy to prescribe realistic boundary conditions in absence of measured data, based on an extension of Murray's law to provide the flow division at bifurcations in case of stenotic vessels and non­-Newtonian blood rheology. Then, we show some results regarding numerical simulations in patients treated with grafts, in which the degree of coronary stenosis is virtually varied to compare the fluid-dynamics in terms of hemodynamic indices potentially involved in restenosis development.

An Overset Grid Method for Oxygen Transport from Red Blood Cells in Capillary Networks ; Adrien Lücker (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Bruno Weber (University of Zurich, Switzerland); Patrick Jenny (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Most oxygen in the blood circulation is carried bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs). In capillaries, the oxygen partial pressure (PO2) is affected by the individual RBCs that flow in a single file. We have developed a novel overset grid method for oxygen transport from capillaries to tissue. This approach uses moving grids for RBCs and a fixed one for the blood vessels and the tissue. This combination enables accurate modelling of the intravascular PO2 field and the unloading of oxygen from RBCs. Additionally, our model can account for fluctuations in hematocrit and hemoglobin saturation. Its parallel implementation in OpenFOAM supports three-dimensional tortuous capillary networks. Simulations of oxygen transport in the rodent cerebral cortex have been performed and are used to study the cerebral energy metabolism. Other applications include the investigation of hemoglobin saturation heterogeneity in capillary networks.
Advanced Computational Methods for Applications to the Cardiovascular System II
Cardiac and Cardiovascular Mathematics represents nowadays a challenging topic in view of the emerging and growing collaborations between clinicians and mathematicians. In this respect, the numerical solution of problems arising in modelling cardiac and systemic phenomena opens new and interesting perspectives which need to be properly addressed. From the cardiac side, a fully integrated heart model represents a complex multiphysics problem, which is in turn composed of several submodels describing cardiac electrophysiology, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. On the system circulation side, although it has been studied for a longer time, several mathematical and numerical aspects still need to be addressed, as e.g. tissue remodelling, atherosclerotic plaque formation, aneurysms development, transitional and turbulence phenomena in blood flows. This minisymposium aims at gathering researchers and experts in computational and numerical modelling of the heart and the systemic circulation.

Co-Authors:
With the shift in HPC system paradigm, applications have to be re-designed to efficiently address large numbers of cores. With the advancements in network technology and communication library's, new opportunities to explore advanced programming models and load-balancing runtime system in large HPC cluster have emerged. However, it requires deep code modification that cannot be practically applied at full-scale application. We propose proto-applications as proxy for code-modernization and we will demonstrate two specialized libraries for HPC workload load-balancing based on the GASPI communication library (PGAS) and task based programming. Our first example features unstructured mesh computation using task-based parallelisation. The second demonstrates load-balancing for combustion simulation. Both proto-applications are open-source and can serve to the development of genuine HPC application.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with GASPI: We presents results both from a proxy application for CFD and its corresponding base application. We demonstrate a much improved strong scaling down to 100 mesh points per thread (on 24,000 threads) on the Intel Xeon Phi. The threading model we have used is a modified domain decomposition where reads occur across thread domains, while writes are restricted to the thread domain. We present a relaxed synchronization model for communication with a multithreaded gather and scatter of ghost cell regions. We believe that this Proxy application is representative for a much broader class of applications which make use of unstructured meshes and as such will useful to a wider community.

We present the Asynchronous Constraint Execution framework (ACE) which has been originally developed for a fully scalable single shot computation of Reverse Time Migration (RTM), the method of first choice in seismic imaging. The basic ingredients of ACE is a fine granular domain decomposition supplemented by an efficient data dependency driven task scheduling on the underlying, possibly heterogeneous compute resources. As such, it provides combined data and task parallelism. This is complemented on the interprocess level by the one-sided communication primitives of GASPI equipped with lightweight remote completion checks. This perfectly fits into the concept of data dependency driven execution and allows for perfect overlap of communication by computation. A contiguous stream of computational tasks to the underlying processing units is guaranteed. The achieved scalability with GPI2.0, the GASPI reference implementation, is almost perfect over three orders of magnitude up to 1,536 nodes (43,008 cores) as tested at LRZ SuperMUC.
Asynchronous Data-Flow Driven Programming with GASPI
Asynchronous data-flow driven programming with GASPI Exascale compute architectures will provide us with systems with a very large number of cores. Correspondingly we expect major challenges in the strong-scaling capabilities of the applications. Due to hardware failures and soft errors the number of cores used in a single simulation may vary. Systems are expected to be heterogeneous with respect to compute resources and they are expected to feature a heterogenous memory architecture. Machine jitter will occur at all scales with a corresponding impact on the relative application performance. Higher resolution and multiphysics simulation will require different parallelization strategies. The number of potential sources for load imbalance hence will significantly increase and the means of sharing data (access, communication, and synchronization) will have to be reconsidered on all available parallelization levels. Fortunately, with the advancements in network technology and communication libraries, new opportunities to explore advanced programming models and load-balancing runtime systems in large HPC clusters have emerged. In this minisymposium we will present applications and libraries which are based on the GASPI communication library (a PGAS API) and a task based programming model. The GASPI API increases communication performance by enabling a complete communication/computation overlap and stimulates an asynchronous, task-based programming style for better load balancing. It does this using concepts and implementation techniques that are not (yet) available in other models (e.g. MPI). This minisymposium will present four talks from different application domains, which make use of hybrid task models and the extended feature set of the GASPI API in order to deliver high scalability and a much improved robustness versus jitter. The applications domains are from Machine Learning in Life Sciences, Seismic Imaging, from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and from a work-stealing application in Combustion CFD. BPMF with GASPI: We present details about a novel implementation of a highly scalable distributed Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization, with near perfect overlap of communication and computation. BPMF is a large scale machine learning application that is able to predict (e.g., movie ratings). Here we consider the prediction of chemical compound activity on systems with millions of items. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with GASPI: We present the results from both a proxy application for CFD and its corresponding base application. We demonstrate a much improved strong scaling down to 100 mesh points per thread (on 24,000 threads) on the Intel Xeon Phi. Seismic Imaging with GASPI: Reverse time migration (RTM) is the method of first choice in seismic imaging. The achieved scalability with GASPI is almost perfect over three orders of magnitude up to 1536 nodes (43008 cores) as tested at LRZ SuperMUC. Distributed work-stealing with GASPI: We present a load-balancing library (based on work stealing) for large scale runs where we demonstrate a chemistry computation in combustion CFD simulation.

Co-Authors: Mike Fisher (ECMWF, United Kingdom)
In 4D-Var, the forecast model is used to propagate the initial state to the time of the observations and is assumed to be perfect. As most aspects of the data assimilation system have improved over the years, this assumption becomes less realistic. There are theoretical benefits in using a weak-constraint formulation and a long assimilation window in 4D-Var and recent experiments have shown benefits in using overlapping assimilation windows even with strong constraint 4D-Var. The weak constraint formulation writes the optimisation problem as a function of the four dimensional state over the length of the assimilation window. In addition to its theoretical advantages, it increases the potential for parallelisation and better scalability. Using a saddle point method make it possible to take full advantage of the potential for additional parallelism. We will show how it can benefit future operational systems and reduce the time to solution in the critical path.

Co-Authors:
Météo-France has been running an operational NWP system at kilometric scale over France for the last 7 years. The aim is in particular to forecast highly precipitating events over the Mediterranean. This is the "AROME" NWP system, which is based on a 3DVar assimilating a comprehensive set of observations, including Doppler radar data and reflectivity. Yet, progress can be expected from increased use of ensembles in data assimilation, to better describe the background error statistics. A new data assimilation scheme is being developed for AROME, named EnVar, in which background error covariances are directly estimated over an ensemble and localized. The variational framework is kept in order to allow to assimilate efficiently a wide range of observations. We will show preliminary results and discuss current achievements in the numerical efficiency of the scheme with particular attention to the localization.

Scalability and performance of the variational data assimilation software NEMOVAR for the NEMO ocean model is presented. NEMOVAR is a key component of the ECMWF operational Ocean analysis System 4 (Ocean S4) and future System 5 (Ocean S5). It is designed as a four dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) algorithm, which can also support three-dimensional (3D-Var) assimilation, using the First-Guess at Appropriate Time (FGAT) approach. Central to the code performance is the implementation of the correlation operator used for modelling of the background error covariance matrix. In NEMOVAR it is achieved using a diffusion operator. A new implicit formulation of the diffusion operator has been introduced recently which solves the underlying linear system using the Chebyshev iteration. The technique is more flexible and better suited for massively parallel machines than the method currently used operationally at ECMWF, but further improvements will be necessary for the future high-resolution applications.

This study will address the numerical solution of the saddle point system arising from four dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation, including a study of preconditioning and its convergence properties. This saddle point formulation of 4D-Var allows parallelization in time dimension. Therefore, it represents a crucial step towards higher computational efficiency, since 4D-Var approaches otherwise require many sequential computations. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in saddle point problems which arise in many other applications such as constrained optimisation, computational fluid dynamics, optimal control and so forth. The key issue of solving saddle point systems with Krylov subspace methods is to find efficient preconditioners. This work focuses on the preconditioners obtained by using limited memory low-rank updates and presents numerical results obtained from the Object Oriented Prediction System (OOPS) developed by ECMWF.
Efficient Data Assimilation for Weather Forecasting on Future Supercomputer Architectures
Data assimilation is the process by which the initial condition for weather forecasts is determined. It combines information from a previous forecast (background) and recent observations of the Earth system, together with estimates of their respective uncertainties, to produce the best estimate of the current state of the system to be used as the initial condition for the forecast. Uncertainty around that best estimate are now also being produced. Weather forecasting models are well known for having always been at the forefront of high-performance computing (HPC). With more and more accurate data assimilation algorithms and more and more observations becoming available, the computational cost of data assimilation has become as high as that of running the forecast. However, this aspect has not been given as much attention in the HPC community. As for other applications, part of the challenge lie in the efficient use of increasingly complex supercomputer architectures. Some challenges such as increasing resolution and increasing I/O volumes are common with the forecasting problem. The fact that forecasting increasingly relies on coupled atmosphere-ocean-waves-land surface models has only just started to be really accounted for in data assimilation. It opens new perspectives as observations in one part of the system could help improve the estimation of the state in another one. However, that will increase its overall cost and complexity. Data assimilation also poses its own specific challenges, due for example to the volume and very heterogeneous distribution of observations over the globe and their very heterogeneous nature. The minisymposium aims at bringing together experts in data assimilation to expose the challenges posed by data assimilation and some of the current directions of research for addressing those, with a focus on the scalability and efficiency aspects. Among others, methods such as weak constraint 4D-Var or ensemble variational methods will be presented as they offer more parallelism in the time dimension or in exploring several directions in the space of solutions in parallel. More efficient methods for modelling background errors statistics will also be discussed.

We demonstrate a convolutional neural network trained to reproduce the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy of hydrocarbons from an input electron density. The output of the network is used as a nonlocal correction to conventional local and semi-local kinetic functionals. We show that this approximation qualitatively reproduces Kohn-Sham potential energy surfaces when used with conventional exchange correlation functionals. The density which minimizes the total energy given by the functional is examined in detail. We identify several avenues to improve on this exploratory work, by reducing numerical noise and changing the structure of our functional. Finally we examine the features in the density learned by the neural network to anticipate the prospects of generalizing these models.

High-throughput density functional calculations of solids are highly time-consuming. As an alternative, we propose a machine learning approach for the fast prediction of solid-state properties. To achieve this, local spin-density approximation calculations are used as a training set. We focus on predicting the value of the density of electronic states at the Fermi energy. We find that conventional representations of the input data, such as the Coulomb matrix, are not suitable for the training of learning machines in the case of periodic solids. We propose a novel crystal structure representation for which learning and competitive prediction accuracies become possible within an unrestricted class of spd systems of arbitrary unit-cell size.

Similarly to density functional calculations with a small basis set, charge equilibration schemes allow to determine charge densities which are constrained by the functional form chosen for representing this charge density. The flow of the charge is determined by the electrostatic interactions and the local electronegativity of all the atoms. By introducing an atomic environment dependent electronegativity, which is predicted by a neural network, we can reach density functional accuracy at a small fraction of the numerical cost of a full density functional calculation for ionic materials. Extension to other materials will also be discussed.
From Materials' Data to Materials' Insight by Machine Learning
The rise of high-throughput computational materials design promises to revolutionize the process of discovery of new materials, and tailoring of their properties. At the same time, by generating the structures of hundreds of thousands of hypothetical compounds, the issue of automated processing of large amounts of materials' data has been made very urgent - to identify structure-property relations, rationalize intuitively the behaviour of materials of increasing complexity, and re-use existing information to accelerate the prediction of properties and accelerate the search of materials' space. To address this challenge, a strongly interdisciplinary effort has developed, uniting forces among researchers in applied mathematics, computer science, chemistry and materials science, that aims at adapting machine-learning techniques to the specific problems that are encountered when working with materials. This minisymposium will showcase the most recent developments in this field, and provide a forum for some of the leading figures to discuss the most pressing challenges and the most promising directions. The participants will be selected to represent the many disciplines that are contributing to this endeavour and will cover the following topics: the representation of materials' structures and properties in a synthetic form that is best suited for automated processing, learning of the structure-property relations and circumventing the large computational cost of high-end electronic structure calculations, the identification of outliers and the automatic assessment of the reliability of input data, demonstrative applications to important materials science problems.

Asymptotically Stable Particle-in-Cell Methods for the Vlasov-Poisson System with a Strong External Magnetic Field ; Francis Filbet (University of Toulouse, France)
Co-Authors:
This work deals with the numerical resolution of the Vlasov-Poisson system with a strong external magnetic field by Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods. In this regime, classical PIC methods are subject to stability constraints on the time and space steps related to the small Larmor radius and plasma frequency. Here, we propose an asymptotic-preserving PIC scheme which is not subjected to these limitations. Our approach is based on first and higher order semi-implicit numerical schemes already validated on dissipative systems. Additionally, when the magnitude of the external magnetic field becomes large, this method provides a consistent PIC discretization of the guiding-center equation, that is, incompressible Euler equation in vorticity form. We propose several numerical experiments which provide a solid validation of the method and its underlying concepts.

iPIC3D is a massively parallel three-dimensional implicit particle-in-cell code used for the study of the interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. Because the scalability potential and scientific impact demonstrated by iPIC3D, it has been selected in many European HPC projects to prepare for the future exascale machines. In this talk, we present new algorithmic changes to iPIC3D in preparation for the coming exascale era. In particular, we will present decoupled computation, communication and I/O operations in iPIC3D to address the challenges of irregular operations on large number of processes. Our evaluation results show that the performance benefits from this model increases as the scale of simulation increases. We also present a two-way coupled kinetic-fluid model with multiple implicit PIC domains (by the iPIC3D code) embedded in MHD (by the BATS-R-US code) under the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF).

Particle methods are very popular for the discretization of kinetic equations, since they are embarrassingly parallel. In plasma physics the high dimensionality (6D) of the problems raises the costs of grid based codes, favouring the mesh free transport with particles. A standard Particle in Cell (PIC) scheme couples the particle density to a grid based field solver using finite elements. In this particle mesh coupling the stochastic error appears as noise, while the deterministic error leads to e.g. aliasing, inducing unphysical instabilities. Projecting the particles onto a spectral grid yields an energy and momentum conserving, almost sure aliasing free scheme, Particle in Fourier (PIF). For few electrostatic modes PIF has very little computational overhead, rendering it suitable for a fast implementation. We present 6D Vlasov-Poisson simulations of Landau damping and a Bump-on-Tail instability and compare the results as well as the computational performance to a grid based semi-Lagrangian solver.

Adaptive Mesh Refinement and Other Adaptive Strategies for Vlasov Simulation ; Erwan Deriaz (CNRS, France)

Simulating the full six-dimensional phase-space Vlasov equations represents a challenge due to the Curse of Dimensionality. In the struggle to reduce the number of degrees of freedom needed in the Eulerian simulations, several adaptive methods were developed. Adaptive Mesh Refinement technics allow to dynamically adapt the grid in an isotropic way. Both Block-Structured [Hittinger, Collela] and Fully-Threaded Tree [Khoklov, Zanoti, Dumbser] implementations succeed in lower-than-three-dimensional kinetic simulations. For higher dimensionality, the authors of adaptive methods tend to favour tensor product structures such as the Tree-of-Tree method [Kolobov], the Sparse Grids [Griebel, Bungartz] or the Tensor-Train method [Oseledets, Kormann]. We propose to discuss and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks.

Grid-based solvers for the Vlasov equation give accurate results but suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To enable the grid-based solution of the Vlasov equation in 6d phase-space, we need efficient parallelization schemes. In this talk, we consider the 6d Vlasov-Poisson problem discretized by a split-step semi-Lagrangian scheme. This method works with successive 1d interpolations on 1d stripes of the 6d domain. We consider two parallelization strategies: A remapping strategy that works with two different layouts keeping parts of the dimensions sequential and a classical partitioning into hyper-rectangles. The 1d interpolations can be performed sequentially on each processor for the remapping scheme. On the other hand, the remapping consists in an all-to-all communication pattern. The partitioning only requires localized communication but each 1d interpolation needs to be performed on distributed data. We compare both parallelization schemes and discuss how to efficiently handle the domain boundaries in the interpolation for partitioning.

Co-Authors:
We study the dynamics of charged particles under the influence of a strong magnetic field by numerically solving the Vlasov-Poisson and guiding center models. We implement an efficient (from the memory access point of view) particle-in-cell method which enables simulations with a large number of particles. We present numerical results for classical Landau damping and Kelvin-Helmholtz test cases. The implementation also relies on a standard hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization. Code performance is assessed by the observed speedup and attained memory bandwidth.
HPC Implementations and Numerics for Kinetic Plasma Models
The fundamental model in plasma physics is a kinetic description by a phase-space distribution function solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equation. Due to the complexity of the models, computer simulations are of key importance in understanding the behaviour of plasmas e.g. in fusion reactors and a wide range of codes exists in the plasma physics community and are run on large-scale computing facilities. However, kinetic simulations are very challenging due to the relatively high-dimensionality, the presence of multiple scales, and turbulences. For this reason, state-of-the-art plasma solvers mostly discretize simplified models like the gyrokinetic equations. Recent advances in computing power render it possible to approach the full six-dimensional system. The focus of the minisymposium is to bring together researchers developing modern numerical methods and optimized implementation of scalable algorithms for a future generation of plasma codes capable of simulating new physical aspects. Two types of methods are used in state-of-the-art Vlasov solvers: particle-based and grid-based methods. Especially for high-dimensional models, particle-based methods are many times preferred due to a better scaling with dimensionality. Even though particle-in-cell codes are embarrassingly parallel, care has to be taken in the layout of the memory structure in order to enable fast memory access on high-performance computers. On the other hand, grid-based methods are known to give accurate results for reduced Vlasov equations in two and four dimensional phase space. Domain partitioning strategies and scalable interpolation algorithms for semi-Lagrangian methods need to be developed. Mesh refinement can also be used to reduce the number of grid points. Macro-scale properties of the plasma can often be described by a fluid model. Spectral discretization methods have the attractive feature that they reduce the kinetic model to a number of moments - thus incorporating a fluid description of plasmas. A central aspect of this minisymposium will be the simulation of highly magnetized plasmas. This is the situation for fusion devices based on magnetic confinement fusion, like the ITER project. In this configuration, the particle exhibit a fast circular motion around the magnetic field lines, the so-called gyromotion. This motion gives rise to multiple scales since turbulences arise on a much slower time scale. Asymptotically preserving schemes can tackle the time scale of the gyromotion beyond the gyrokinetic model.

During last decades, computational scientists have experienced a sustained and continuous increase in models complexity. Current models are not only more detailed and accurate but also span across multiple scales and scientific domains. Instead of writing complicated and monolithic models ex novo, we have explored the coupling of existing single-scale and single-science applications in order to produce multi-scale and multi-science models. We have proposed a theoretical formalism which allows to describe how submodels are coupled (Multiscale Modeling Language - MML), as well as a coupling library (MUSCLE) which allows to build arbitrary workflow from the submodels. Currently, we are exploring the execution of such model across several computing resources, in order to increase available CPU power. In order to properly deploy an execution across several clusters we have developed a discrete event simulator able to predict the relevance of a given an allocation scheme.

This contribution describes an instance of the practitioner approach to application tuning for HPC deploy, starting on a small-size server and applying a black-box approach to performance tuning. The bio-medical iCardioCloud project aims at establishing a computational framework to perform a complete patient-specific numerical analysis specially oriented to aortic diseases. The application is based on CFD. The work here reported shows the SE basic approach to tuning within a black-box approach: optimisation of the build process, analysis of module dependencies, assessment of possible compiler-based optimisations, final targeting on a specific architecture, generation of various scripts for optimised builds. The experience gained with this study case shows to which extent a skilled IT professional is actually required in a domain specific application to move the process from a naive to an advanced solution.

One of the major challenges in mass-spec driven proteomics research is data-analysis. Many research facilities have the capacity to generate several gigabytes of data per hour. To process such data though, software solutions for high-throughput data analysis often require a cluster computing infrastructure. Since many research facilities do not have the required IT infrastructure for large-scale data-processing, this kind of proteomics research was restricted to only a few proteomics groups. Here we present a software solution that is capable of processing terabytes of large proteomics experiments on a cheap desktop gaming PC setup. We will focus on how to overcome the issue of limited resources while still maintaining a high-throughput data-analysis and reasonable scalability.
Software Engineering Meets Scientific Computing: Generality, Reusability and Performance for Scientific Software Platforms II: Performance and Scalability Requirements
Software platforms for modelling and simulation of scientific problems are becoming increasingly important in many fields and often drive the scientific discovery process. These platforms present unique requirements in terms of functionalities, performance and scalability, which limit the applicability of consolidated software engineering practices for their design, implementation and validation. For instance, since the effectiveness of a software platform for scientific simulation strictly depends on the level of performance and scalability it can achieve, the design, development and optimization of the platform are usually tailored to the specific hardware architecture the platform is expected to run on. Similarly, when a scientific simulation requires the integration of multiple software platforms, such integration is typically customized for the specific simulation problem at hand. Because of this, developing and integrating scientific computing platforms demands for a significant amount of relevant knowledge about the modeled domain and the software and hardware infrastructures used for simulation. This information typically remains hidden in the implementation details of a specific solution and cannot be easily reused to port the simulation to different hardware infrastructures or to implement or integrate different simulation platforms on the same hardware infrastructure. The Software Engineering for Scientific Computing (SESC) symposium is concerned with identifying suitable engineering processes to design, develop, integrate and validate software platforms for scientific modelling and simulations. This introduces challenges that require the expertise of researchers working in different areas, including computational scientists to model scientific problems, software engineers to propose engineering methodology and HPC experts to analyze platform dependent performance requirements that characterize simulations. The goal of the SESC minisymposium is to bring together software engineers, computational scientists and HPC experts to discuss and advance the engineering practices to implement platforms for scientific computing, aiming to reduce the development time, increase the reusability, the maintainability and the testability of the platforms, while offering the level of performance and scalability that is required by the simulation scenarios at hand. Specifically, the Software Engineering for Scientific Computing (SESC) minisymposium aims to address two conflicting requirements in the definition of an effective software development process: 1) promoting generality and reusability of software components, to simplify maintenance, evolution, adaptation and porting of software platforms 2) defining solution that guarantee an adequate level of performance and scalability, which is of paramount importance in scientific simulations. The SESC minisymposium is organized around two sessions: this session targets the requirements of performance and scalability in scientific software platforms; the other session (Part 1) focuses more specifically on design methodologies and development processes for general and reusable code.

Abstract
We live in an era in which the creation of new data is growing exponentially such that every two days we create as much new data as we did from the beginning of mankind until the year 2003. One of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st century is to effectively understand and make use of the vast amount of information being produced. Visual data analysis will be among our most important tools to understand such large and often complex data. In this talk, I will present state-of-the-art visualization techniques, applied to important Big Data problems in science, engineering, and medicine.

Challenges for Climate and Weather Prediction in the Era of Heterogeneous Computer Architectures: Oscillatory Stiffness, Time-Parallelism, and the Slow Manifold ; Beth Wingate (University of Exeter, UK)
Abstract
For weather or climate models to achieve exascale performance on next-generation heterogeneous computer architectures they will be required to exploit on the order of million- or billion-way parallelism. This degree of parallelism far exceeds anything possible in today's models even though they are highly optimized. In this talk I will discuss the mathematical issue that leads to the limitations in space- and time-parallelism for climate and weather prediction models - oscillatory stiffness in the PDE. I will go on to discuss recent successful time-parallel algorithms including the fast-converging asymptotic parareal method and a time-parallel matrix exponential.

We present a high performance comprehensive implementation of a multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) simulation on multicore architectures with hardware accelerators in the context of computational astronomy. This implementation will be used as an operational testbed for simulating the design of new instruments for the European Extremely Large Telescope project (E-ELT), the world's biggest eye and one of Europe's highest priorities in ground-based astronomy. The simulation corresponds to a multi-step multi-stage procedure, which is fed, near real-time, by system and turbulence data coming from the telescope environment. Based on the PLASMA library powered by the OmpSs dynamic runtime system, our implementation relies on a task-based programming model to permit an asynchronous out-of-order execution. Using modern multicore architectures associated with the enormous computing power of GPUs, the resulting data-driven compute-intensive simulation of the entire MOAO application, composed of the tomographic reconstructor and the observing sequence, is capable of coping with the aforementioned real-time challenge and stands as a reference implementation for the computational astronomy community.

This article describes how we manage to increase performance and to extend features of a large parallel application through the use of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) and by designing a robust parallel transpose algorithm. The semi-Lagrangian code Gysela typically performs large physics simulations using a few thousands of cores, between 1k cores up to 16k on x86-based clusters. However, simulations with finer resolutions and with kinetic electrons increase those needs by a huge factor, providing a good example of applications requiring Exascale machines. To improve Gysela compute times, we take advantage of efficient SMT implementations available on recent INTEL architectures. We also analyze the cost of a transposition communication scheme that involves a large number of cores in our case. Adaptation of the code for balance load whenever using both SMT and good deployment strategy led to a significant reduction that can be up to 38% of the execution times.

Co-authors:
We present a high-performance framework for single- and multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo methods applicable to a large class of problems in uncertainty quantification. A typical application of interest is the approximation of expectations of quantities depending on solutions to e.g. partial differential equations with uncertain inputs, often yielding integrals over high-dimensional spaces. The goal of the software presented in this paper is to allow recently developed quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods with high, dimension-independent orders of convergence to be combined with a multilevel approach and applied to large problems in a generic way, easing distributed memory parallel implementation. The well-known multilevel Monte Carlo method is also supported as a particular case, and some standard choices of distributions are included. For so-called interlaced polynomial lattice rules , a recently developed QMC method, precomputed generating vectors are required; some such vectors are provided for common cases. After a theoretical introduction, the implementation is briefly explained and a user guide is given to aid in applying the framework to a concrete problem. We give two examples: a simple model problem designed to illustrate the mathematical concepts as well as the advantages of the multilevel method, including a measured decrease in computational work of multiple orders of magnitude for engineering accuracy, and a larger problem that exploits high-performance computing to show excellent parallel scaling. Some concrete use cases and applications are mentioned, including uncertainty quantification of partial differential equation models, and the approximation of solutions of corresponding Bayesian inverse problems. This software framework easily admits modifications; custom features like schedulers and load balancers can be implemented without hassle, and the code documentation includes relevant details.

The increasing complexity of the software/hardware stack of modern supercomputers makes understanding the performance of the modern massive-scale codes difficult. Distributed graph algorithms (DGAs) are at the forefront of that complexity, pushing the envelope with their massive irregularity and data dependency. We analyse the existing body of research on DGAs to assess how technical contributions are linked to experimental performance results in the field. We distinguish algorithm-level contributions related to graph problems from "runtime-level" concerns related to communication, scheduling, and other low-level features necessary to make distributed algorithms work. We show that the runtime is an integral part of DGAs' experimental results, but it is often ignored by the authors in favor of algorithm-level contributions. We argue that a DGA can only be fully understood as a combination of these two aspects and that detailed reporting of runtime details must become an integral part of scientific standard in the field if results are to be truly understandable and interpretable. Based on our analysis of the field, we provide a template for reporting the runtime details of DGA results, and we further motivate the importance of these details by discussing in detail how seemingly minor runtime changes can make or break a DGA.

Signal transduction across cellular membranes is controlled by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is widely accepted that members of the GPCR family self-assemble as dimers or higher-order structures being functional units in the plasma membrane. The chemokines receptors are GPCRs implicated in a wide range of physiological and non-physiological cell processes. These receptors represent prime targets for therapeutic intervention in a wide spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, cancer and HIV. The CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors are two of the manly studied playing crucial roles in different pathologies. In this scenario the use of computational techniques able to describe complex biological processes such as protein dimerization acquires a great importance. Combining coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics (MetaD) we are able to describe the mechanism of dimer formation, capturing multiple association and dissociation events allowing to compute a detailed free energy landscape of the process.

Individual fish swimming in a school encounter vortices generated by the propulsion of upstream members. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that these hydrodynamic interactions may increase thrust without additional energy expenditure. However, difficulties associated with experimental studies have prevented a systematic quantification of this phenomenon. Using simulations of self-propelled swimmers, we investigate some of the mechanisms by which fish may exploit each others' wake to reduce energy expenditure. We quantify the relative importance of two mechanisms for increasing swimming efficiency: the decrease in relative velocity induced by proximity to wake vortices; and wall/"channelling" effects. Additionally, we conduct simulations of fish swimming in the Karman vortex street behind a static cylinder. This configuration helps us clarify the role of the bow pressure wave, entrainment, and "vortex-surfing" in enhancing propulsive efficiency of trout swimming near obstacles.

Ion-Cyclotron Range of Frequency (ICRF) waves is an efficient source of plasma heating in tokamaks and stellarators. In ICRF heated plasmas, the resonating particles phase-space distribution function displays significant distortion. A significant consequence is to modify noticeably the plasma properties which dictates the propagation of the ICRF wave. The self-consistent modelling tool SCENIC was built in order to solve this highly non-linear problem. It is one of the few ICRF modelling tools able to tackle both 2D and 3D plasma configurations. The computational resources, in particular the amount of shared memory required to resolve the plasma equilibrium and the wave propagation, significantly increases for simulations of strongly 3D equilibrium such as stellarators compared to 2D tokamaks calculation. We present some applications of SCENIC to tokamak and stellarator plasmas. Particular focus is given to simulations of the recenlty started Wendelstein7-X stellarator experiment which will use ICRF waves for fast particle generation.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is extensively used for modelling of blood flow in intracranial aneurysms as it can help clinicians in decision for intervention, and may potentially provide information on the pathogenesis of the condition. The flow regime in aneurysms, due to low Reynolds number is mostly presumed laminar - an assumption that was challenged in recent publications that showed high frequency fluctuations in aneurysms resembling transitional flow. The present work aspires to scrutinize the issue of transition in aneurysmal hemodynamics by performing first true direct numerical simulations on aneurysms of various morphologies, with resolutions of the order of Kolmogorov scales, resulting in 1 billion cells. The results show the onset of fluctuations in flow inside aneurysm during deceleration phase of the cardiac cycle before a re-laminarization during acceleration. The fluctuations confine in the aneurysm dome suggesting the manifestation of aneurysm as an initiator of transition to turbulence.

Due to the massive penetration of alternative renewable energies, hydraulic power plants are key energy conversion technologies to stabilize the electrical power network using hydraulic machines at off design operating conditions. For a flow rate larger than the one at the best efficient point a cavitating vortex rope occurs, leading to strong pressure surges in the entire hydraulic system. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the pressure surges, URANS simulations of a reduced scale Francis turbine are performed. Several sigma values are investigated corresponding to stable and unstable cavitating vortex ropes. The results are compared with the experimental measurements. The main challenge of the computations is the long physical time, compared to the time step, required to capture the beginning of the instability.

Parallel-in-time integration techniques have been hailed as a potential paths to exascale for the solution of evolution type problems. Methods of time-parallel integration are intended to extend parallel scaling on compute clusters beyond what is possible using conventional domain decomposition techniques alone. In this talk we give a short introduction to space-time parallelism with emphasis on the parareal method. We then proceed to present resent advances in the construction of the coarse operator needed in the iterative correction scheme. The modifications allow for parallel-in-time acceleration of purely hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations, something previously widely considered impractical. The talk is concluded with a presentation of preliminary results on parallel-in-time integration of a two-dimensional shallow-water-wave equation that governs the underlying dynamics in a tsunami simulation application.

PERMON forms a collection of software libraries, uniquely combining quadratic programming (QP) algorithms and domain decomposition methods (DDM), built on top of the well-known PETSc framework for numerical computations. Among the main applications are contact problems of mechanics. Our PermonFLLOP package is focused on non-overlapping DDM of the FETI type, allowing efficient and robust utilization of contemporary parallel computers for problems with billions of unknowns. Any FEM software can be used to generate mesh and assemble the stiffness matrices and load vectors per each subdomain independently. Additionally, a mapping from the local to the global numbering of degrees of freedom is needed, and non-penetration and friction information in case of contact problems. All these data are passed to PermonFLLOP, which prepares auxiliary data needed in the DDM. PermonQP is then called in the backend to solve the resulting equality constrained problem with additional inequality constraints in case of contact problems.

DBCSR is the sparse matrix library at the heart of the CP2K linear scaling electronic structure theory algorithm. It is MPI and OpenMP parallel, and can exploit accelerators. The multiplication algorithm is based on Cannon's algorithm, whose scalability is limited by the MPI communication time. The implementation is based on MPI point-to-point communications. We present an improved implementation that takes in account the sparsity of the problem in order to reduce the communication. This implementation makes use of one-sided communications. Performance results for representative CP2K benchmarks will be also presented.

The presentation deals with the energy consumption evaluation of the FETI method blending iterative and direct solvers in the scope of READEX project. The measured characteristics on model cube benchmark illustrate the behaviour of preprocessing and solve phases related mainly to the CPU frequency, different problem decompositions, compiler's type and compiler's parameters. In preprocessing it is necessary to factorize the stiffness and coarse problem matrices, which belongs to the most time and also energy consuming operations. The solve employs the conjugate gradient algorithm and consists of sparse matrix-vector multiplications and vector dot products or AXPY functions. In each iteration we need to apply direct solver twice for pseudo-inverse action and coarse problem solution. All these operations cover together the basic Sparse and Dense BLAS Level 1, 2 and 3 routines, so that we can explore their different dynamism and dynamic switching between various configurations can then provide significant energy savings.

Tensor-Product Discretization for the Spatially Inhomogeneous and Transient Boltzmann Equation , Simon Pintarelli (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Philipp Grohs (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Ralf Hiptmair (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
The Boltzmann equation provides a fundamental mesoscopic model for the dynamics of rarefied gases. The computational challenge arising from it's discretization is twofold: we face a moderately high-dimensional problem and the collision operator is non-linear and non-local in the velocity variable. We aim for a deterministic and asymptotically exact Galerkin discretization. This sets our approach apart from stochastic Monte-Carlo-type and Fourier based methods. We consider a tensor product discretization of the distribution function combining Laguerre polynomials times a Maxwellian in velocity with continuous first-order finite elements in space. Unlike the Fourier spectral methods, our approach does not require truncation of the velocity domain and it does not suffer from aliasing errors. The advection problem is discretized through a Galerkin least-squares technique and yields an implicit formulation in time. Numerical results of benchmark simulations in 2+2 dimensions will be presented.

Numerical weather prediction and climate models like COSMO and ICON solve explicitly a large set of PDEs. The STELLA library was successfully used to port the dynamical core of COSMO providing a performance portable code across multiple platforms. A significant performance speedup was obtained for NVIDIA GPUs as reported in doi>10.1145/2807591.2807676. However its applicability was restricted to only cartesian structured grids, finite difference methods, and is difficult to be used outside the COSMO model. The GridTools project emerges as an effort to provide an ecosystem for developing portable and efficient grid applications for the explicit solution of PDEs. GridTools generalizes STELLA to a wider class of weather and climate models on multiple grids: Cartesian and spherical, and offers facilities for performing communication and setting boundary conditions. Here we present the GridTools API and show performance on NVIDIA GPUs and x86 platforms.

The solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is needed in many applications in computational science and engineering. For an important class of PDEs multigrid methods are optimal solvers, nevertheless the choice of the right components can be difficult, especially in a parallel environment, as is the parallel implementation on up-to-date supercomputers with millions of cores, accelerators etc. Within the project ExaStencils we work on the automatic generation of multigrid methods to achieve higher productivity as well as performance portability through the automatic choice of different components of multigrid methods and the associated parameters optimised for a given hardware architecture. The core of ExaStencils is a hierarchy of domain specific languages that provide different levels of abstraction. The languages address the needs of application scientists, mathematicians, and computer scientists and allow for different optimisations. In this talk an overview over the current state of the project will be provided.

Co-Authors:
In the German Research Foundation project ESSEX (Equipping Sparse Solvers for Exascale), we develop scalable sparse eigensolver libraries for large quantum physics problems. Partners in ESSEX are the Universities of Erlangen, Greifswald, Wuppertal, Tokyo and Tsukuba as well as DLR. The project pursues a coherent co-design of all software layers where a holistic performance engineering process guides code development across the classic boundaries of application, numerical method and basic kernel library. Within ESSEX the numerical methods cover widely applicable solvers such as classic Krylov, Jacobi-Davidson or recent FEAST methods and domain specific iterative schemes relevant for the ESSEX quantum physics applications. Using the ESSEX software framework, we present recent work on sparse eigenvalue solvers for heterogeneous computing systems with a focus on the difficult problem of finding interior eigenvalues. In this context, we also discuss the application of the CARP-CG method as a preconditioner for applications such as Graphene simulation.

The Fast Multipole Method is a generic toolbox algorithm for many important scientific applications, e.g. molecular dynamics. It enables us to compute all long-range O(N^2) pairwise interactions for N particles in O(N) for any given precision. Unfortunately, the runtime of such simulations is already communication bound. To increase the performance on modern HPC hardware, a more sophisticated parallelization scheme is required. Especially the reduction of MPI collectives is a vital issue to increase the strong scaling. In this talk we will focus exclusively on the internode communication via MPI. We will present a latency-avoiding communication scheme and its implementation for our C++11 FMM toolbox. The implementation consists of several layers of abstraction to hide/encapsulate low level MPI calls and specifics of the communication algorithm. We will also show examples of the scaling capabilities of the FMM on a BG/Q for small and medium size MD problems.

Fault Tolerance and Silent Fault Detection for Higher-Dimensional Discretizations ; Dirk Pflüger (University of Stuttgart, Germany)
Co-Authors: Alfredo Parra Hinojosa (Technische Universität München, Germany)
Future exascale systems are expected to have a mean time between failure in the range of minutes. Classical approaches such as checkpointing and then recomputing the missing solution will be therefore out of scope. Algorithm-based fault tolerance in contrast aims to continue without recomputations and with only minor extra computational effort. Therefore, numerical schemes have to be adapted. We present algorithm-based fault tolerance for the solution of high-dimensional PDEs. They exploit a hierarchical extrapolation scheme, the sparse grid combination technique. Using the hierarchical ansatz, we show how hard faults can be mitigated without checkpoint-restart. Furthermore we explain how even soft faults (for example due to silent data corruption) can often be detected and handled.
Development, Adaption, and Implementation of Numerical Methods for Exascale
Nowadays supercomputers with millions of cores, specialized communication networks and in many cases accelerators pose big challenges for the development of scientific applications. In most cases, the efficiency of these applications largely dominated by one or a few numerical methods. As a consequence these underlying methods have to be able to use the available machine efficiently. The Priority Programme 1648 SPPEXA funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) aims at tackling software challenges that arise on the way to exascale. One important part of these challenges are extremely scalable methods. SPPEXA's first year of its second three-year funding period started in January. In this minisymposium a subset of the project specifically addressing the challenges in numerical methods will present their approaches towards exascale numerics. The topics include fault tolerance, latency avoiding and automatic code generation, as well as strategies to achieve the extreme scalability that will be needed in the future.

Turbulence Simulations at Extreme Scales: A Path Towards Exascale ; Diego Donzis (Texas A&M University, United States of America)
Co-Authors:
Turbulence is the most common state of fluid motion in nature and engineering and is critical in environmental, astrophysical and engineering flows. However, the complexity of the governing equations leads to wide ranges of temporal and spatial scales and render the problem almost intractable analytically. Thus, simulations, in particular direct numerical simulations (DNS) which resolve the entire range of scales from the exact governing equations, have become an indispensable tool to advance the field. While very accurate spectral methods have been used extensively up to petascale levels, they typically require collective communications and synchronizations, two well-known potential bottlenecks at exascale. We present our recent work on novel asynchronous numerical schemes that virtually remove computational obstacles at a mathematical level and present a path towards exascale DNS of turbulent flows. We will highlight implications, challenges and opportunities in terms of numerical issues, parallel performance, and implementation issues on future exascale systems.

Fluid Mechanics of Electrochemical Interfaces: Instability and Chaos Near Ion-Selective Surfaces ; Ali Mani (Stanford University, United States of America)
Co-Authors:
Electrochemical interfaces are host to a range of physical phenomena involving ion-transport, electrostatics and fluid flow. In this presentation, we consider voltage-driven ion transport from an aqueous electrolyte to an ion-selective membrane as a canonical setting with broad applications in electrochemistry. We will present results from our numerical simulations demonstrating that, beyond a threshold voltage, such interfaces trigger hydrodynamic chaos with multi-scale vortices despite their low Reynolds number. Namely, structures with scales from sub-millimeter down to tens of nanometers can be formed as a natural result of these hydrodynamic instabilities. These flow structures are shown to impact mixing and enhance system-level transport well beyond nominal diffusion-controlled processes. We will demonstrate the need for the development of specialized algorithms for computation of these systems, similar to the tools that have been traditionally used for the simulations of turbulent flows. Such calculations require massively parallel computational resources beyond what is available today.

Co-Authors:
Methods for the (MPI-based) parallel numerical solution of free-surface flow problems using an ALE-based finite-element method will be presented. The deforming fluid domain is treated as a pseudo-elastic solid for small deformations, but can also be completely remeshed to handle extreme changes. Techniques for the continuation of solution branches in the presence of remeshing will be described and used to demonstrate the existence of new solutions for the canonical problems of viscous fluid flow on the outside or inside of rotating cylinders, and to quantify the accuracy of thin-film approximations. The same techniques will also be used to characterise the solution structure that develops for two-phase flow in partially-occluded Hele-Shaw cells. That system becomes more sensitive as the aspect ratio is increased in the sense that multiple solutions are provoked for smaller occlusions, which is conjectured to underlie the experimentally observed sensitivity of such cells at large aspect ratios.

SPH-Flow is a multi-purpose, multi-physics CFD software based on the SPH method (smoothed particle hydrodynamics). It is developed by Ecole Centrale Nantes and Nextflow Software. The solver was first developed for fluid flow simulations dedicated to complex non-linear free surface problems and has then been extended to multi-fluid, multi-structure, fluid/structure interaction and viscous flows. It relies on state of the art meshless algorithms. SPH-Flow solver is parallelized with a distributed memory parallelization relying on a domain decomposition. Today, the applicative computations usually performed involve 64 to 4000 processors, depending on the problem. New industrial problems can now be solved with this method and its efficient HPC implementation. This talk will address the description of the SPH-Flow solver and parallelization. Massively parallel complex innovative simulations will then be discussed: Tire aquaplaning simulations, Wave impacts on a ship, Fluid flow in a car gear box and River-crossing simulations of a car.

Co-Authors: Javier Jiménez (Technical University of Madrid, Spain)
A new high order, high resolution hybrid MPI-CUDA code for the simulation of turbulent channel flow on many distributed GPUs is presented. The code benefits from the use of powerful and efficient heterogeneous architectures with GPUs accelerators. Optimization strategies involving the joint use of GPU and CPU lead to excellent performance. Asynchronous GPU-CPU execution achieves almost complete overlap of computations, memory transfer from/to device/host and MPI communications. A considerable speedup is gained with respect to similar synchronous codes. Test cases and performance results show the code is suitable for the next generation of large direct numerical simulations of turbulence.
High-Performance Computing in Fluid Mechanics II
Large-scale computer simulations have become an indispensable tool in fluid dynamics research. Elucidating the fundamental flow physics or designing and optimizing flows for applications ranging all the way from low Reynolds number multiphase flows at small length scales to fully developed turbulence at large scales requires state-of-the art simulation capabilities. The need for large-scale HPC simulations in fluids dynamics has therefore been driving the development of novel simulation algorithms and of optimized software infrastructure. The envisioned PASC 16 symposium will bring together both developers and users of modern simulation tools. The set of talks will showcase a wide range of fields in which HPC computations are essential, highlight recent advances in computational methods and provide a platform to identify challenges and opportunities for future research.

Big Data is introducing a number of inescapable trends. Firstly, we are creating data at an exponential rate. Second, we need to use complicated algorithms to unlock the potential of the data. This combination results into the realisation that Big Data workloads are fast crossing into the realm of HPC. Challenges, that include how to merge the Big Data and HPC computing paradigms, how to virtualise HPC so as the serve the vast numbers of Big Data programmers and users and how to keep up with performance expectations in a post Moore's law landscape are clearly hot topics. We will discuss these issues and give a glimpse of what we think are ways forward.

Big Data Challenges Arising from Future Experiments ; Dirk Pleiter (Juelich Supercomputing Centre, Germany)
Co-Authors:
Future physics experiments and observatories rely on the capabilities to process significantly larger data streams. Examples are future light-source experiments, elementary particle experiments and radio-astronomy observatories. All have in common that they plan to exploit high-performance compute capabilities instead of relying on hardware controlled data processing. This approach increases flexibility during the lifetime of such experiments and may increase the use of commodity hardware, which is typically cheaper compared to custom solutions. While these experiments can thus benefit from HPC architectures and technologies, both as being available today as well as planned on future roadmaps, the requirements and use models differ significantly from today's high-performance computing. In this talk we will analyse the requirements of a few examples and discuss how they will benefit from current as well as future HPC technologies.

Operating large computing systems reliably and efficiently requires to implement fine grain monitoring and tuning policies in order to contain operational costs while increasing reliability. Data collected during operations, to be used on the fly, or to be analysed offline represent a wealth of information to be exploited. One particularly interesting area is near real-time predictive analysis that would enable to swiftly take corrective action in case of excursions or impending component failures, with minimal interruptions of service. Moving and integrating data originating from heterogeneous sources however presents several challenges in the development of solutions to automate the process. The majority of data sets originates from specialized storage systems, log files, environmental data and relational databases. With hierarchical data analysis and enough data monitoring at hand, predictive fault models based on machine learning can be developed at scale.

Compute, Analyze and Visualize: Novel Workflows on GPU Accelerated Supercomputers ; Peter Messmer (NVIDIA, United States of America)
Co-Authors:
Supercomputers are typically used in a batch oriented fashion: simulations are launched via queuing system, intermediate results stored on a global file system and the final results are obtained via post-processing on a separate visualization system. The amount of data generated by large-scale simulations and the increasing complexity of analysis and visualization algorithms turn this last step into a HPC problem by itself and render the traditional workflow inadequate. The tremendous compute power and their advanced graphics capabilities make GPUs the ideal accelerator for modern HPC systems, enabling not only floating point intensive workloads, but also big data analysis and visualization tasks with the same massively parallel resource, enabling novel workflows like exploratory analysis or application monitoring and steering. In this talk, I will introduce some hardware and software features on modern GPUs supporting such workflows and present some use-case examples.

The discovery of new materials has an incredible impact on our daily life. Traditionally, the discovery of these new materials is extremely labor-intensive, requiring material scientists to analyse large numbers of documents and to conduct numerous experiments and simulations. As the number of documents published scales exponentially with time, this approach is not practical. Therefore, the field of material science is ideally suited for a cognitive computing approach. In this talk, we present how a cognitive computing approach can be used to improve our understanding and accelerate the discovery of new materials. We will discuss in detail how cognitive algorithms can analyse large number of documents and catalogue automatically extracted materials and their properties. Furthermore, we will explain how these extracted data can be used in simulations to extend our knowledge. In this way, our cognitive algorithms form an embedding for the traditional material simulations and extend their reach.
HPC for the Big Data Era
Big Data is rapidly expanding into the HPC domain. This is driven by computational needs of Big Data applications that render these characteristic candidates for HPC. At the same time, the ever increasing fidelity of models and simulations is changing traditional HPC applications to data intensive workloads as well. These trends pose immensely interesting new challenges that span all the way from low level H/W design to programming environments and algorithms. How do we reconcile the need for massive I/O while bringing the computation as much as closer to the data. How do we merge the HPC and Big Data run-time and programming environments. What needs of cloud like virtualization can be answered by HPC knowledge and vice-versa. And finally, how do visualize immense amounts of data in meaningful ways. This minisymposium will attempt to introduce these trends and provide an overview of the landscape as well as a few directions for emerging designs, especially in view of exascale systems.

Realistic simulations of planetary dynamos will remain impossible in the near future. Especially the enormous range of spatial and temporal scales induced in convective flows by rotation plagues direct numerical simulations (DNS). The same scale disparities that hamper DNS can however be used to derive reduced equations that are expected to govern convection in the limit of rapid rotation. Simulations based on such formulations represent an interesting alternative to DNS. In this talk, recent efforts to test asymptotic models against DNS are reviewed. Results in plane layer geometry reveal convergence of both approaches. Surprisingly, Ekman layers have a profound effect in the rapidly rotating regime and explicitly have to be accounted for in the asymptotic models. Upscale kinetic energy transport leads to the formation of large-scale structures, which may play a prominent role in dynamos. The asymptotic models allow an exploration of parameter regimes far beyond the capabilities of DNS.

In a next generation dynamo experiment currently under development at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) a fluid flow of liquid sodium, solely driven by precession, will be considered as a possible source for magnetic field generation. In my talk I will present results from hydrodynamic simulations of a precession driven flow in cylindrical geometry. In a second step, the velocity fields obtained from the hydrodynamic simulations have been applied to a kinematic solver for the magnetic induction equation in order to determine whether a precession driven flow will be capable to drive a dynamo at experimental conditions. It turns out that excitation of dynamo action in a precessing cylinder at moderate precession rates is difficult and future dynamo simulations are required in more extreme parameter regimes where a more complex fluid flow is observed in water experiments which is supposed to be beneficial for dynamo action.

Co-Authors:
We study thermal convection driven by internal heating in a rotating sphere for low Prandtl numbers. Our model assumes that the velocity is invariant along the axis of rotation due to the rapid rotation of the system, while the temperature is computed in 3D. We find the presence of two dynamical branches: a weak branch that is connected to the linear onset of convection and a strong branch with large values of the convective and zonal velocities. 
Understanding the Dynamics of Planetary Dynamos
Realistic numerical simulations of planetary dynamos are impossible to carry out with current computational resources due to the extreme conditions under which they operate. As a result, simulations are performed with parameters values that are quite distant from those that are typical of planets. How close are the current state-of-the art dynamo simulations for a realistic planetary system? Are direct numerical simulations the right approach for investigating the extreme parameter regime that characterizes planetary cores, or is there an alternative? This minisymposium aims to present the latest advances in understanding the dynamics of planetary dynamos through well-established direct numerical simulations, asymptotic modelling as well as novel numerical algorithms.

The ParaDiS project at LLNL was created to build a scalable massively parallel code for the purpose of predicting evolution of strength and strain hardening and crystalline materials under dynamic loading conditions by directly integrating the elements of dislocation physics. The code has been used by researchers at LLNL and around the world to simulate the behaviour of dislocation networks in a wide variety of applications, from high temperature structural materials, to nuclear materials, to armor materials, to photovoltaic systems. ParaDiS has recently been extended to include a fast analytical algorithm for the computation of forces in anisotropic elastic media, and an augmented set of topological operations to treat the complex core physics of dislocations and other dislocations that routinely appear in HCP metals. The importance and implications of these developments on the engineering properties of HCP metals will be demonstrated in large scale simulations of strain hardening.

The reliability of metallic nanostructures, such as, nanowires and thin films, is often dictated by their mechanical failures. An in-depth understanding in the effects of their intrinsic factors such as grain boundaries and surface roughness and extrinsic factors such as size, shapes and man-made notches on their plastic deformation mechanisms and failure patterns is of great importance in fabricating these nanostructures with high reliability. In this talk, we will first briefly review various deformation mechanisms and failure patterns in literature and highlight some of critical issues that currently are under active research. We will then report our recent progresses in the study of the effects of intrinsic factors, such as grain boundaries and dislocations and extrinsic factors such as sizes, shapes and man-made notches, on the plasticity and failure of metallic nanostructures using both mechanical testing and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.

Although the framework of Dislocation Dynamics (DD) provides powerful tools to model crystal plasticity, their efficient implementation is crucial in order to simulate very large ensembles of dislocations. Among all the steps involved in DD simulations, the computation of the internal elastic forces and energy are the most resource consuming. However, since they are long-ranged interactions, they can be efficiently evaluated using the Fast Multipole Method (FMM). We propose a new FMM formulation based on polynomial interpolations, that is optimised to reduce the memory footprint and the number of flops using fast Fourier transforms. These optimisations are necessary because of the tensorial nature of the kernel and the unusual memory requirements of this application. Regarding parallelism, our code benefits from a hybrid OpenMP/MPI paradigm and a cache-aware data structure. Numerical results will be presented to show the accuracy of this new approach and its parallel scalability.

Multiscale Modelling of Dwell Fatigue in Polycrystalline Titanium Alloys ; Zebang Zheng (Imperial College London, United Kingdom)
Co-Authors: Daniel Balint (Imperial College London, United Kingdom); Fionn Dunne (Imperial College London, United Kingdom)
Titanium alloys are used for manufacturing highly stressed components of gas turbine engine such as discs and blades due to their low density, excellent corrosion resistance and high fatigue strength. However, it has been reported that these alloys exhibit a significant fatigue life reduction, called dwell debit, under cyclic loading that includes a hold at the peak stress. In this study, a rate-dependent crystal plasticity framework was first used to reproduce the experimentally observed macroscopic response of Ti624x (x = 2 and 6) alloys under low-cycle fatigue and low-cycle dwell fatigue loading, which enabled relevant material constants for the two alloys to be determined. These were then utilized in a discrete dislocation plasticity model using the same thermally activated rate controlling mechanism to examine the dwell behaviour of the alloys.

Atomistic Modelings of Dislocation Cross-Slips in HCP Metals ; Zhaoxuan Wu (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: William Curtin (EPFL, Switzerland)
HCP metals such as Mg, Ti and Zr are a class of lightweight and/or highly durable metals with critical structural applications in the automotive, aerospace and nuclear industries. However, the fundamental mechanisms of deformation, strengthening and ductility in them are not well-understood, resulting in significant challenges in their plasticity models at all scales. We present the dislocation cross-slips in Mg using a DFT-validated interatomic potential and very large scale NEB calculations on HPC systems. We reveal a unique dislocation cross-slip mechanism and quantify the cross-slip energy barrier and its stress-dependence, which leads to tension-compression asymmetry and a switch in absolute stability of slip planes. All these are generic to HCP metals but very different from those well-established for cubic metals. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the cross-slip behaviour, rationalize the pyramidal I/II slip stability and enable the prediction of slip trends across the family of HCP metals.
Applications and Algorithms for HPC in Solid Mechanics I: Plasticity
Plastic deformation is made possible by the motion of interacting crystalline defects. In the study of the mechanisms controlling the macroscopic and effective plastic laws, it is of particular importance to understand the collective behaviour of dislocations. Available models generally represent dislocations with nodes connected with segments which can form a complex network structure. Within these forests, dislocations can nucleate, interact, join, annihilate. This forms an important challenge because of the many defaults present in the crystals such as impurities, grain boundaries and free surfaces. In order to capture the correct physics of the described processes, the employed (self-) interaction laws and the mobility laws have to be correctly acknowledged. Furthermore, the number of dislocation segments need to be important if one wants to achieve calculations comparable with experimental scales. In parallel, full atomistic simulations can provide insights into detailed mechanistic aspects of dislocation nucleation, transformation, and reactions that occur at the nanoscale, below the capabilities of mesoscale dislocation models. Consequently, the numerical calculations are challenging and call for HPC strategies. This minisymposium aims at fostering discussion on the newest advancements of the numerical models, accompanying algorithms, and applications. Also, we encourage researchers working in the field of dislocation plasticity to present analytic models and experimental results that complement studies performed with parallel algorithms.

Many problems in economics and game theory can be formulated as systems of polynomials. Methods from commutative algebra and numerical algebraic geometry can be used to find all solutions but the computational costs rise significantly as the size increases. Mathematicians have developed methods that exploit parallelism but have deployed them only on small systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of these methods on supercomputers, with a focus on solving research problems in economics.

The project deploys statistical and computational techniques to develop a novel approach to causality inference in multivariate time-series of economical data on equity and credit risks. The methods build on recent research of project participants. They improve on classical approaches to causality analysis by accommodating general forms of non-stationarity and non-homogeneity resulting from unresolved and latent scale effects. Emerging causality framework results in and is implemented through a clustering based on a minimization of the averaged clustering functional, which describes the mean distance between observation data and its representation in terms of given number of abstract Bayesian causality models of a certain predefined class. We are using finite element framework to propose a numerical scheme. One of the most challenging components of the emerging HPC implementation is a Quadratic Programming problem with linear equality and bound inequality constraints. We compare different algorithms and demonstrate the efficiency solving practical benchmark problems.

Computing Equilibria in Dynamic Stochastic Macro-Models with Heterogeneous Agents ; Johannes Brumm (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Felix Kubler (University of Zurich, Switzerland); Simon Scheidegger (University of Zurich & Stanford University, Switzerland)
We show how sparse grid interpolation methods in conjunction with parallel computing can be used to approximate equilibria in overlapping generation (OLG) models with aggregate uncertainty. In such models, the state of the economy can be characterized by the wealth distribution across generations/cohorts of the population. To approximate the function mapping this state into agents' investment decisions and market prices, we use piece-wise multi-linear hierarchical basis functions on (adaptive) sparse grids. When solving for the recursive equilibrium function, we combine the adaptive sparse grid with a time iteration procedure resulting in an algorithm that is massively parallelisable. Our implementation is hybrid-parallel and can solve OLG models with large (depreciation) shocks and with 60 continuous state variables.

Using recent advances in approximation theory, we apply a combination of Gaussian processes and active subspace techniques to approximate policy functions in models with at least 100 continuous states. Moreover, we show that our method is perfectly suited for dynamic programming and time iteration on non-cubic geometries such as simplices.

Uncertainty Quantification and Global Sensitivity Analysis for Economic Models ; Daniel Harenberg (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Viktor Winschel (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Stefano Marelli (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Bruno Sudret (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
We present a method for global sensitivity analysis of the outcomes of an economic model with respect to their parameters. Traditional sensitivity analyses, like comparative statics, scenario and robustness analysis are local and depend on the chosen combination of parameter values. Our global approach specifies a distribution for each parameter and approximates the outcomes as a polynomial of parameters. In contrast to local analyses, the global sensitivity analysis takes into account non-linearities and interactions. Using the polynomial, we compute the distribution of outcomes and a variance decomposition called Sobol' indices. We obtain an importance ranking of the parameters and their interactions, which can guide calibration exercises and model development. We compare the local to the global approach for the mean and variance of production in a canonical real business cycle model. We find an interesting separation result: for mean production, only capital share, leisure substitution rate, and depreciation rate matter.

Exact Present Solution with Consistent Future Approximation: A Gridless Algorithm to Solve Stochastic Dynamic Models ; Pontus Rendahl (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom)
Co-Authors:
This paper proposes an algorithm that finds model solutions at a particular point in the state space by solving a simple system of equations. The key step is to characterize future behaviour with a Taylor series expansion of the current period's behaviour around the contemporaneous values for the state variables. Since current decisions are solved from the original model equations, the solution incorporates nonlinearities and uncertainty. The algorithm is used to solve the model considered in Coeurdacier, Rey, and Winant (2011), which is a challenging model because it has no steady state and uncertainty is necessary to keep the model well behaved. We show that our algorithm can generate accurate solutions even when the model series are quite volatile. The solutions generated by the risky-steady-state algorithm proposed in Coeurdacier, Rey, and Winant (2011), in contrast, is shown to be not accurate.
Computational Economics
This minisymposium provides an overview of recent developments in how computational methods are applied to economic problems. These include, for instance, the inference of causality relations from large data-sets. Another example and focus of this symposium is the solution, estimation, and uncertainty quantification of dynamic stochastic economic models in fields like optimal taxation, asset pricing, or climate change. Solving such models is particularly challenging because of the feedback from the future that the expectations of the modeled economic agents create. This feature combined with the substantial heterogeneity that successful models of economic phenomena have to incorporate often results in dynamical systems with high-dimensional state spaces, confronting economists with the curse of dimensionality. Methods to alleviate this curse include adaptive sparse grids and active subspace methods. Moreover, such problems often require substantial computation time even if an efficient solution method is applied. Fortunately, the generic structure of many of these problems allows for massive parallelization and is thus a perfect application of modern high-performance computing techniques. This minisymposium brings together recent developments along those lines.

Coping with Underdetermined Biological Network Inference ; Rudiyanto Gunawan (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
Many problems of great importance in systems biology involve inferring causal relationships among cellular components from high-throughput biological data. Such inferences typically face significant challenges due to the curse of dimensionality. This issue translates to solving an underdetermined inverse problem, for which there could exist multiple solutions. In this talk, I will present an ensemble inference strategy for addressing underdetermined causal inference particularly when using gene transcriptional expression data for inferring gene regulatory networks. In particular, I will introduce an inference algorithm called TRaCE (Transitive Reduction and Closure Ensemble) for identifying the ensemble of network graphs from expression data of gene knock-out experiments. Furthermore, I will describe an ensemble-based optimisation of gene knock-outs, called REDUCE (Reduction of Uncertain Edges). Finally, I will demonstrate that by iterating TRaCE and REDUCE, we could resolve the underdetermined inference of gene regulatory networks. These tools are available from our website: http://www.cabsel.ethz.ch/tools.

Models of codon evolution are widely used to identify signatures of positive selection in protein coding genes. While the analysis of a single gene family usually takes less than an hour on an average computer, the detection of positive selection on genomic data becomes a computationally intensive problem. In order to support our full genome database of positive selection 'Selectome' (http://selectome.unil.ch/) we develop a series of high-performance computing tools to analyse positive selection. These improvements allow us to develop new and more realistic, but computationally tractable, models of codon evolution.

Genomics-based biological research (e.g., next-generation sequencing) generates increasingly amounts of data, which need dedicated high-performance computing (HPC) resources to be analysed efficiently. However, the specialization in both areas (namely, genomics and HPC) makes it increasingly challenging to bring the two fields together and to leverage the usage of available computational resources by biologists. The mission of Scientific IT Services (SIS) of ETH Zurich is to bridge this gap and to provide client-tailored solutions for big data genomics. In this presentation, we illustrate this need and our approach by selected examples ranging from the design of automated, high-throughput NGS analysis workflows through addressing the biology "software stack jungle" to scientific IT education for biologists. Throughout the talk, we emphasize the importance of scientific data management, consulting needs and community building for using HPC in biological research.

Detection of positive selection on phylogenetic trees, where new advantageous genetic variants dominate in a population, is of a great importance to study gene evolution. However the high computational cost of such a detection in existing implementations limits its applicability. Taking advantage of modern parallel computing systems and clusters as well as different algorithmic techniques, we implemented a new software (known as FastCodeML) that substantially improve the limitations of existing solutions in terms of performance and scalability. We briefly introduce the underlying mechanisms of FastCodeML and discuss its gains over existing implementations.

Speeding Up All-Against-All Sequence Alignment Among Thousands of Genomes ; Christophe Dessimoz (University of Lausanne, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
Orthology inference and other sequence analyses across multiple genomes typically start by performing exhaustive pairwise sequence comparisons, a process referred to as "all-against-all". As this process scales quadratically in terms of the number of sequences analysed, this step can become a bottleneck, thus limiting the number of genomes that can be simultaneously analysed. For the OMA database, developed in our laboratory, we have performed "all-against-all", between 2000 complete genomes, at a computational cost of several million CPU hours. In this talk, I will report on some of the strategies we have explored to speed-up the "all-against-all" step while maintaining its sensitivity.

Climate simulations using horizontal resolution of O(1km) allow to explicitly resolve deep convection. Precipitation processes are then represented much closer to first principles and allow for an improved representation of the water cycle. Due to the large computational costs, climate simulations at such scales were restricted to rather small domains in the past. Here we present results from a decade-long convection-resolving climate simulation covering Europe using a computational mesh of 1,536x1,536x60 grid points. We use a COSMO-model prototype enabled for GPUs. The results illustrate how the approach allows representing the interactions between atmospheric circulations at scales ranging from 1,000 to 10 km. We discuss the performance of the convection-resolving climate modelling approach and thereby specifically focus on the improved representation of summer convection on the continental scale. Furthermore we demonstrate the potential of online analyses of these simulations for assembling detailed climatologies of extratropical cyclones, fronts and propagating convective systems.

The importance of adapting numerical methods and the underlying algorithms to the hardware where these algorithms will be used is becoming crucial in many areas, including weather and climate modelling, engineering, finance, life sciences, etc. This aspect is even more important when targeting large HPC systems and will become a key for successfully produce large-scale simulations on the next generation HPC platforms. The current work explores a strategy being developed as part of the Horizon2020 ESCAPE project that tries to address this issue within the context of Weather & Climate modelling. In particular, we identified some key building blocks (also referred to as dwarfs) of Weather & Climate models, we isolated them and we created related self-contained mini-applications. These mini-applications can be tested on different hardware and re-adapted (eventually changing the underlying algorithms or changing the overall strategy) to achieve the best performance on different platforms.

Our aim is to adopt the COSMO limited-area model to enable kilometer-scale resolution in climate simulation mode. As the resolution of climate simulations increases, storing the large amount of generated data becomes infeasible. To enable high-resolution models, we find a good compromise between the disk I/O costs and the need to access the output data for post-processing and analysis. We propose a data-virtualization layer that re-runs simulations on demand and transparently manages the data for the analytics applications. To achieve this goal, we developed a bit-reproducible version of the dynamical core of the COSMO model that runs on different architectures (e.g., CPUs and GPUs). An ongoing project is working on the reproducibility of the full COSMO code. We will discuss the strategies adopted to develop the data virtualization layer, the challenges associated with the reproducibility of simulations performed on different hardware architectures and the first promising results of our project.

As the resolution of the forecasts produced by ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) is refined, the amount of data involved continues its geometric growth. Current peak loads already require an otherwise oversized parallel storage filesystem (Lustre). The data volume is expected to grow 6-fold by 2020, to reach 120TB/day, concentrated in short 1 hour bursts. Moreover, this data requires post-processing to create the final forecast products sent to end-users, introducing a further I/O bottleneck. Realizing these challenges, ECMWF's Scalability Programme aims to redesign the data workflow to minimize I/O in the time-critical path, whilst retaining resilience to failures. The authors are investigating multiple solutions to tackle issues of data locality, data volume and overall resilience. Solutions range from a novel NVRAM hardware co-design effort inside the EU funded NEXTGenIO project, to the use of distributed object storage technologies and a new dynamic worker-broker solution for managing the post-processing workload.

Co-Authors: Tim N. Palmer (Oxford University, United Kingdom)
In weather and climate models values of relevant physical parameters are often uncertain by more than 100%. Still, numerical operations are typically calculated in double precision with 15 significant decimal digits. If we reduce numerical precision, we can reduce power consumption and increase computational performance significantly. If savings in computing power are reinvested, this will allow an increase in resolution in weather and climate models and an improvement of weather and climate predictions. I will discuss approaches to reduce numerical precision beyond single precision in HPC and in weather and climate modelling. I will present results that show that precision can be reduced significantly in atmosphere models and that potential savings are huge. Finally, I will discuss how to reduce precision in weather and climate models most efficiently and how rounding errors will impact on model dynamics and predictability. I will also outline implications for data assimilation and data storage.
Kilometer-Scale Weather and Climate Modeling on Future Supercomputing Platforms
The development of weather and climate models has made rapid progress in recent years. With the advent of high-performance computing (HPC), the computational resolution will continue to be refined in the next decades. This development offers exciting prospects. From a climate science perspective, a further increase in resolution will make it possible to explicitly represent the dynamics of deep convective and thunderstorm clouds without the help of semi-empirical parameterizations. From a computer science perspective, this strategy poses major challenges. First, emerging hardware architectures increasingly involve the use of heterogeneous many-core architectures consisting of both CPUs and accelerators (e.g., GPUs). The efficient exploitation of such architectures requires a paradigm shift and has only just started. Second, with increasing computational resolution, the models' output becomes unbearably voluminous, the delay from I/O unacceptably large, and long-term storage prohibitively expensive. Ultimately, there is no way around conducting the analyses online rather than storing the model output. This approach implies conducting model reruns (i.e., repeat simulations for refined analysis). These developments pose new challenging computer science questions, which need to be addressed before an efficient exploitation of new hardware systems becomes feasible. The proposed minisymposium is designed as an interdisciplinary workshop between climate and computer scientists, and its overall scope is the further development of high-resolution climate models. Specific aspects to be addressed include the numerical and computational formulation of non-hydrostatic dynamical models on heterogeneous next-generation many-core hardware architectures, the use of novel online analyses methods and model reruns in extended simulations, the virtualization of climate model simulations, as well as the development of bit-reproducible codes across different hardware architectures. Two of the listed presentations (those of Oliver Fuher and David Leutwyler) are centered around a recently developed GPU-enabled version of the COSMO model. This limited-area model is probably the first full atmospheric model that runs entirely on GPUs. It is currently evaluated in a pre-operational test suite for numerical weather prediction, and has already been used for European-scale decade-long climate simulations. Further development and exploitation of the model in a climate setting is currently being undertaken within the project crCLIM (http://www.c2sm.ethz.ch/research/crCLIM). The two organizers of this minisymposium are involved in this project.

Co-Authors:
First principles methodologies have grown in accuracy and applicability to the point where large databases can be built and analysed to predict novel compositions.The discovery process is rooted on the knowledge of descriptors: quantities that link selected microscopic features of the materials to macroscopic functional properties. To be useful, descriptors should be as simple as possible and, at the same time, reliable and transferable across chemical compositions and structural themes. Within the AFLOW consortium we have developed a simple frame to expand, validate, and mine data repositories: the MTFrame. Our minimalistic approach complement AFLOW and other existing high-throughput infrastructures and aims to integrate data generation with data analysis. I will present present examples from our work on novel materials for electromechanical energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and transparent conductors. My intent is to pinpoint the usefulness of our descriptors to guide the discovery process and quantitatively structuring the scientific intuition.

Co-Authors:
The high-throughput computation of materials properties by ab initio methods has become the foundation of an effective approach to materials design, discovery and characterization. This approach to materials science currently presents the most promising path to the development of advanced technological materials that could solve or mitigate important social and economic challenges of the 21st century. Enhanced repositories such as AFLOWLIB open novel opportunities for structure discovery and optimisation, including uncovering of unsuspected compounds, metastable structures and correlations between various properties. However, the practical realization of these opportunities depends on the the design of efficient algorithms for electronic structure simulations of realistic material systems beyond the limitations of the current standard theories. In this talk, I will review recent progress in theoretical and computational tools, and in particular, discuss the development and validation of novel functionals within Density Functional Theory and of local basis representations for effective ab initio tight-binding schemes.

As a crucial step towards the identification of novel and promising 2D materials, we provide here a large scale first-principles exploration and characterization of such compounds. From a combination of 480,000 structures harvested from the ICSD and COD databases, three-dimensional crystals are screened systematically by checking the absence of chemical bonds between adjacent layers, identifying more than 6,000 layered systems. Then DFT calculations of the van der Waals interlayer bonding are performed with automatic workflows, while systematically assessing the metallic, insulating or magnetic character of the materials obtained. Following full atomic and cell relaxations, phonon dispersions are computed as a first step towards the assessment of thermodynamic properties. Thanks to the AiiDA materials' informatics platform [1], and in particular its automatic workflow engine, database structure, sharing capabilities, and pipelines to/from crystallographic repositories, the systematic and reproducible calculation of these properties becomes straightforward, together with seamless accessibility and sharing.

Designing New Materials with the High-Throughput Toolkit ; Rickard Armiento (Linköping University, Sweden)
Co-Authors:
I give a brief overview of our recently launched software framework for large-scale database-driven high-throughput computation, with a few examples of recent applications. The High-throughput toolkit (httk) is a comprehensive open-source software library that enables preparation, execution, and analysis of ab initio simulations in high-throughput with a high level of automatization. The framework also comprises functionality for sharing cryptographically signed result sets with other researchers. This framework powers our online materials-genome-type repository of ab inito predicted materials properties at http://openmaterialsdb.se. Examples of recent use of httk are the generation of training data for a machine learning model used to predict formation energies of 2M Elpasolite (ABC2D6) crystals (arXiv:1508.05315 [physics.chem-ph]) and to analyse phase stability of a class of materials based on substitutions into AlN. Current work in progress includes extending the toolkit for our ongoing research into the use of big data methods for materials design.

The Long Way to the Discovery of New Magnets Made it Short ; Mario Zic (Trinity College Dublin, Ireland)
Co-Authors:
Magnetic materials underpin many modern technologies, but their development is a long and often unpredictable process, and only about two dozen feature in mainstream applications. Here we describe a systematic pathway to the discovery of novel magnetic materials, presenting an unprecedented throughput and discovery speed. An extensive electronic structures library of Heusler alloys is filtered for those alloys displaying magnetic order and thermodynamical stability. A full stability analysis for intermetallic Heuslers made only of transition metals (36,540 prototypes) results in 248 thermodynamically stable but only 20 magnetic. The magnetic ordering temperature, Tc, is then estimated by a regression calibrated on the experimental values of about 60 known compounds. As a final validation we have grown two new magnets: Co2MnTi, displays a remarkably high Tc in perfect agreement with the predictions, and Mn2PtPd is a complex antiferromagnet. Our work paves the way for large-scale high-speed design of novel magnetic materials.
Materials Design by High-Throughput Ab Initio Computing
Materials advances often drive technological innovation (faster computers, more efficient solar cells, more compact energy storage). Experimental discovery of new materials suitable for specific applications is, however, a complex task, relying on high costs and time-consuming procedures of synthesis. Computational materials science is now powerful enough for predicting many materials properties even before synthesizing those materials in the lab and appears as a cheap basis to orient experimental searches efficiently. Recent advances in computer speed and first-principles algorithms have led to the development of fast and robust codes, making it possible to do large numbers of calculations automatically. This is the burgeoning area of high-throughput first-principles computation. The concept though simple is very powerful. High-throughput calculations are used to create large databases containing the calculated properties of existing and hypothetical materials. These databases can then be intelligently interrogated, searching for materials with desired properties and so removing the guesswork from materials design. Various open-domain on-line repositories have appeared to make these databases available to everyone. Areas of applications include solar materials, topological insulators, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, materials for catalysis, battery materials, etc. While it has reached a good level of maturity, the high-throughput first-principles approach still requires many improvements. Several important properties and classes of materials have not been dealt with yet, and further algorithm implementations, repositories and data-mining interfaces are necessary. This minisymposium will be devoted to the presentation of the most recent developments in this field. It will also provide an agora for some of the leading researchers to put forward the most recent achievements, to address the current challenges, and to discuss the most promising directions. The speakers will be selected to illustrate the many disciplines that are contributing to this effort, covering practical applications (e.g., magnetic materials, thermoelectrics, transparent conductors, 2D materials), theoretical developments (e.g., novel functionals within Density Functional Theory, local basis representations for effective ab-initio tight-binding schemes), and technical aspects (e.g., high-throughput frameworks).

N-Body Time Integration: Towards Time Reversability ; Walter Dehnen (University of Leicester, United Kingdom)
Co-Authors:
Astrophysical N-body problems range from planetary system to galaxies and the whole universe. The dynamical times of individual particles in such systems vary by many orders of magnitude. Therefore, N-body simulations employ individual adaptive time steps, which for reasons of efficiency are discretised and hierarchically organised (block-step). The N-body problem itself satisfies time-reversibility and it is therefore desirable that the simulation codes do too to avoid artificial dissipation. However, all current methods to adapt individual time steps with the block-step fail to preserve time reversibility. I investigate the seriousness of this violation and discuss possible ways to alleviate the situation. It appears that it is impossible to adapt the time steps reversibly with block-step in an explicit and efficient way, but nearly time reversible methods, better than current practice, are possible.

A New Reverse Tree-Method for Self Gravity Calculation Applied to Fixed Grid FV Methods ; Clement Surville (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
We present a new hybrid approach bringing the Tree algorithm for gravity calculation to the frame of fixed grid finite volume methods. The goal is to obtain a N log(N) complexity on cylindrical or spherical coordinate systems. The main property of our method is to build an approximate tree of the gravity field rather than a tree of the mass distribution. The algorithm has also the property to produce the exact gravity at some position of space (largest nodes of the tree). Finally, we show how fast and accurate the method could be on modern supercomputers.

New Time Step Criterion in Gravitational N-Body Simulations ; Hasanuddin (University of Leicester, United Kingdom)
Co-Authors: Walter Dehnen (University of Leicester, United Kingdom)
We present a new time step criterion for gravitational N-body simulations that is based on the norm of gradient tensor of the acceleration that is not gauge invariance in all circumstance and based on the orbital time of particle. We have tested this time step criterion in the simulation of single orbit with high eccentricity as well as N-Body problem using direct summation force calculation and a Plummer model as the initial condition. This time step criterion requires fewer force evaluation than other time step criteria.

GENGA: A GPU N-Body Code for Terrestrial Planet Formation ; Simon Grimm (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
GENGA is a GPU N-body code, designed and optimised to simulate the process of terrestrial planet formation and long term evolution of (exo-) planetary systems. The use of the parallel computing power of GPUs allows GENGA to achieve a significant speedup compared to other N-body codes. The entire simulation is performed on the GPU, to avoid slow memory transfer. GENGA uses a hybrid symplectic integration scheme, which allows a very good energy conservation level even in the presence of frequent close encounters and collisions between individual bodies. The code can be used with three different computational modes: The main mode can integrate up to 32,768 fully gravitational interacting planetesimals, the test particle mode can integrate up to 1 million massless bodies in the presence of some massive planets or protoplanets. And the third mode allows the parallel integration of up to 100,000 samples of small exoplanetary systems with different parameters.

Co-Authors: Martin Kunz (University of Geneva, Switzerland)
Cosmological structure formation is a highly non-linear process that can only be studied with the help of numerical simulations. This process is mainly governed by gravity, which is the dominant force on large scales. A century after the formulation of general relativity, numerical codes for structure formation still use Newton's law of gravitation. In my talk I will present results from the first simulations of cosmic structure formation using equations consistently derived from general relativity. Our particle-mesh N-body code gevolution computes all six degrees of freedom of the metric and consistently solves the geodesic equation for particles, taking into account the relativistic potentials and the frame-dragging force. Thanks to this, we were able to study in detail for a standard ΛCDM cosmology the small relativistic effects that cannot be obtained within a purely Newtonian framework.

Towards a Multi Million GPU Cores for Exascale Astrophysical High Order Direct N-Body Simulations ; Peter Berczik (Heidelberg University, Germany)
Co-Authors:
We present the set of high accuracy direct N-body numerical simulations (up to N=6M particles) with the large scale different mass galaxy-galaxy collisions. We use our own developed high performance and high order (4th - 6th - 8th) parallel individual timestep Hermite direct N-body code (phi-GPU) with the maximum possible numerical resolution. For the simulation we use the largest astrophysical GPU clusters (including the TITAN GPU supercomputer in the US which holds second place in top 500 list). The code uses all the possible multi scale parallelizations (large scale MPI, local multi-thread CPU with OpenMP and local multi-thread GPU with CUDA). The central Black Holes (BH) are simulated as a special particles with the Post Newtonian force corrections (up to 1/c^7 terms) implemented for the BH versus BH interactions, which allow us follow the BH's gravitational waves mergers up to the final seconds.
N-Body Simulations Techniques
Many astrophysical systems are modelled by N-body simulations, where the simulated particles either correspond directly to physical bodies (such as in studies of the Solar system and star cluster) or are representative of a much larger number of collisionlessly moving physical objects (such as in studies of galaxies and large-scale structure). N-body systems are Hamiltonian systems and simulating their long-term evolution is a difficult numerical challenge because of shot noise, errors of the approximated forces, and strong inhomogeneities of the systems in both space and time scales. This latter point is a major difficulty for the development of efficient and scalable algorithms for HPC architectures.

HPC systems offer tremendous computing resources, often difficult to harness for Visualization applications. In fact, even though not often "massively" parallel, these applications can stress the system in numerous ways, while trying to execute in parallel on ALL subsystems (disk I/O, CPU, and GPU rendering). We will talk about VTK, an unarguably leading open-source Visualization effort which has been able to spread very early to the HPC world, and how it is today, embracing all new forms of parallelism, and advanced computing and data analysis methods and rendering. Through two end-user applications, VisIt and ParaView, we will give examples of scientific visualizations, and talk about the impact of VTK's latest release (its seventh major release) in the HPC world.

Data-Parallel Processing Using Madagascar Open-Source Software Package ; Sergey Fomel (University of Texas at Austin, United States of America)
Co-Authors:
Many data analysis tasks in geophysics are data-parallel: the same process is applied in parallel on different parts of the input dataset. The Madagascar open-source software package provides a number of general-purpose tools to simplify data-parallel processing. These tools allow the user to develop serial code and easily run it in a data-parallel fashion on a multicore computer or a computer cluster. Different tools take advantage of different modes of parallelization (multi-threading, shared memory with OpenMP, distributed memory with MPI, etc.). They employ Unix-style data encapsulation to wrap serial code using forks and pipes. I will describe the current collection of data-parallel tools and will show examples of their usage in solving geophysical data analysis problems. I will also make suggestions for further development inviting input from the open-source community.

Within all domain-specific software projects, finding the correct balance between flexibility and performance is often difficult. In the seismic imaging community, the trend has been to move towards codes which are heavily optimised, but which often sacrifice usability and flexibility. Here we introduce Salvus: an open-source HPC high-order finite element (FE) package focused on full-waveform modelling and inversion, which is designed to be both flexible and performant. Salvus was constructed by following modern software design practices, testing protocols, and by establishing its foundations upon existing open-source high-level scientific libraries. The FE framework is generalized over spatial dimensions, time-integrators, polynomial order and wave-propagation physics, and provides support for both hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. Additionally, support is included for various numerical optimisation methods. We discuss our usage of existing open-source scientific libraries, our choice level of abstraction, and quantitatively investigate the performance penalties associated with these abstractions.

Co-Authors: Jeffrey Shragge (University of Western Australia, Australia)
Over the past decade the open-source Madagascar framework has been used for reproducible computational seismology research by a growing community of researchers. While Madagascar is commonly used for single-node applications, the increasing number and the computational complexity of user-submitted software tools (e.g., 3D seismic modelling, imaging and inversion codes) are pushing the limits of computational tractability at the workstation level. There is a growing interest and community experience in using Madagascar for cluster-scale public HPC facilities and cloud-based computing environments. In this presentation we highlight our procedure for interfacing Madagascar with publicly accessible HPC clusters, and provide case studies of using Madagascar for large-scale 3D seismic modelling and imaging activities. We present our recent efforts of moving toward a reproducible Madagascar framework within a cloud-computing environment, and provide an example of running 3D acoustic modelling on Australia's NECTAR cloud computing grid using a combination of Python, ZeroMQ, and Cython.

Post-petascale supercomputers are now available to solve scientific problems that were thought unreachable a decade ago. They also bring a cohort of concerns tied to obtaining optimum performance. These include energy consumption, fault resilience, scalability of current parallel paradigms, workflow management, I/O performance and feature extraction with large datasets. We focus on the last three issues. The overarching goal is to reduce the time to solution. Experiments show that the imaging workflow suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks. Such limitations occur both for computational data and seismic time series. The latter are dealt with by the introduction of a new Adaptable Seismic Data Format (ASDF). HDF5 and ADIOS are used to reduce the cost of disk access. Because large parts of the workflow are embarrassingly parallel, we are investigating the possibility of automating the process with the integration of scientific workflow management tools, specifically Pegasus.

Although the hexahedral Spectral Element Method (SEM) has become a standard tool in computational seismology, the main difficulty in applications remains the meshing: until today, no robust algorithm exists that allows automatic meshing of complex geological geometries. Here we demonstrate how the concept of the SEM can be applied to tetrahedral elements, for which such automated meshing tool exist. The key idea has previously been applied to the acoustic wave equation (Zhebel et al 2014) and consists in obtaining a stable quadrature rule with strictly positive weights by adding extra quadrature points in the interior of the elements. In this way, a diagonal-mass matrix is achieved while maintaining the order of convergence. We present the basic rational and show convergence up to fourth order in space and time. Finally, we compare our method and its implementation against the performance profile of existing hexahedral SEM implementations.
Open Source Software (OSS) and High Performance Computing (HPC)
Open Source Software (OSS) plays a fundamental role in research-driven projects and, for this reason, it cannot be neglected by academia and industry. OSS is radically transforming how software is being developed by various scientific communities and it is likely to be central to future research activities in many more fields. The process of development has to reach beyond organizational boundaries to unleash new potentials and open paths to new collaborations. OSS scientific applications are required to solve complex and data-intensive research problems. These applications range from smaller scale simulations developed on a desktop machine to large, parallel simulations of the physical world using High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. The minisymposium is focused on identifying specific aspects of Open Source Software for the development of scientific software that exploits High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures. This class of OSS applications includes software developed to perform, for example, modelling of wave propagation in the Earth and real-time visualization of great volumes of data. This minisymposium will bring researchers from various environments together to exchange experience, findings, and ideas in the realm of Open Source Software. The speakers will demonstrate a practical working success related to OSS and HPC and present future directions for where we need to go.

To leverage the computational power of many-core architectures of GPUs and Xeon Phi, suitable software library interfaces are required such that complex applications with many interacting components can be built. This talk discusses new challenges that have to be addressed in software library development for using many-core architectures in computational science: First, different programming models, most notably OpenMP, CUDA, and OpenCL, are in use. The ideal software library supports all of these approaches. Second, it is not enough to optimise for a single architecture. Different device generations provide different characteristics such as cache or scratchpad memory sizes; thus, a single optimised kernel is not sufficient. Third, extensive testing and performance monitoring require the availability of physical hardware; virtual machines are not enough. The audience will learn how these challenges are addressed in the ViennaCL library and which future directions are taken for further improvement.

VexCL is a C++ vector expression template library for fast GPGPU prototyping and development. It provides convenient notation for various vector operations, and generates OpenCL/CUDA kernels on the fly from C++ expressions. Among the challenges met during the library development were the need to support multiple backends (OpenCL/CUDA), the fact that the OpenCL compute kernel language is C99 and thus lacks some conveniences of C++, etc. The talk provides brief overview of the library implementation and the C++ techniques used to overcome the difficulties.

A significant amount of future exascale-class high performance computer systems are projected to be of heterogeneous nature, featuring "standard" as well as "accelerated" resources. A software infrastructure that claims applicability for such systems must be able to meet their inherent challenges: multiple levels of parallelism, complex topologies, asynchronicity, and abstraction. The "General, Hybrid, and Optimized Sparse Toolkit" (GHOST) is an open-source library of building blocks for sparse linear algebra algorithms on current and future large-scale systems. Being built on the "MPI+X" paradigm, it provides truly heterogeneous data parallelism and a light-weight and affinity-aware tasking mechanism for multicore CPUs, Nvidia GPUs, and the Intel Xeon Phi. Important design decisions are described with respect to the challenges posed by modern heterogeneous supercomputers and recent algorithmic developments. Implementation details which are indispensable for achieving high efficiency are pointed out and their necessity is justified by performance measurements or predictions based on performance models.

Co-Authors: Carter Edwards (Sandia National Laboratories, United States of America)
HPC libraries have provided abstractions for common and performance critical operations for decades. When uniform memory architectures were predominant, the main focus of library implementers was algorithm implementation, while data structures and layout had a secondary role. As memory architectures become more diverse, it became necessary to adjust simultaneously algorithmic needs and memory characteristics. Several recent library approaches tackle this problem, especially as performance portability is now essential. In this talk we will describe two libraries that address these issues: Kokkos and GridTools. Kokkos provides two fundamental abstractions: one for dispatching work for parallel execution and one for managing multidimensional arrays with polymorphic layouts. GridTools' main abstraction allows a programmer to describe complex stencil applications in an architecture agnostic way. Both libraries use the template mechanisms in C++ for high flexibility, thus avoiding source-to-source translators and proprietary annotations.
Software Libraries in Computational Science for Many-Core Architectures
Many-core architectures such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and many integrated cores (MIC) emerged in scientific computing. The efficient use of these architectures, however, is very challenging from the algorithmic perspective, as fine-grained parallelism needs to be fully exposed in the software stack. However, many widely-used libraries in scientific computing today were designed for processors with only a few cores and hence struggle to provide good support for such many-core architectures. At the same time, new libraries designed especially for GPUs and MIC emerge. The speakers in this minisymposium are developers of software libraries for GPUs and MIC and explain their approaches. They discuss strategies for dealing with the subtle differences of these architectures in order to provide portable performance on the users' machines. The discussion also touches the design of new application programming interfaces which are simple enough for use by application scientists, but also provide optional control over important details for domain experts. Overall, this session presents the state-of-the-art in libraries for many-core architectures and sketches a path forward for making these architectures more accessible to a broad user base.

Abstract
The use of stochastic optimisation strategies for first principles structure prediction is now well established. There are many examples of these techniques making genuine discoveries. Ab Initio Random Structure Searching (AIRSS), in which initial starting structures are randomly generated and relaxed repeatedly, is extremely simple, reliable and suited to high throughput computation. Typical functional materials are ternary, or quaternary compounds. It is important to perform a search over compositional space as thoroughly and broadly as possible. I will discuss how AIRSS may be used to do this, paying particular attention to pulling apart structures we have already found, to make new, random ones.

CLAW Provides Language Abstractions for Weather and Climate Models , Jonathan S. Rood (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Valentin Clément (Center for Climate Systems Modeling (C2SM), ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Achieving near optimal performance on different architectures (e.g., CPUs and GPUs) with a single source code is sometimes not possible and requires refactoring of the most performance critical code towards a desired architecture. This is the essence of 'performance portability' and this situation has been observed in several cases involving numerical weather and climate models. To help alleviate this situation, we are developing a tool named CLAW whose function is to allow developers to encode architecture-specific transformations into a single Fortran source. Our tool utilizes source-to-source compiler techniques to extend the Fortran grammar in a simple manner that allows the developer to activate the necessary code transformations automatically before compilation. To generalize the capabilities of the CLAW tool, we currently consider its use in the COSMO weather model and HAMMOZ and ICON climate models.

The recent increase of the computational power enables running of climate simulations at the kilometer-scale resolution. This modeling approach is able to explicitly resolve deep convection (i.e., thunderstorms and rain showers), and thus allows reducing some of the key uncertainties in current climate models.   Here we present analyses of decade-long climate change simulations at horizontal resolution of 2.2km across a greater Alpine region. The simulations have been conducted on a Cray XE6 system using a setup with 2000 cores on a computation mesh of 500x500x60 grid points. The results show great improvement in the simulation of summer precipitation, and demonstrate the importance of kilometer-scale resolution in climate change projections.

From Code to Climate: Adjusting Free Parameters in a Global Climate Model , Doris Folini (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Martin Wild (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
The discretization of global climate models (GCMs) is too coarse to resolve a number of climate relevant processes. For example, the deep convection associated with tropical thunderstorms is of key relevance for the global atmospheric circulation, yet it enters GCMs only via sub-grid-scale parameterization of thunderstorms. Typically, such parameterizations come with some free parameters that need adjusting in order to obtain a 'physically meaningful climate', a process referred to as 'model tuning'. We illustrate this process at the example of MPI-ESM-HAM, the Max Planck Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) coupled to the Hamburg Aerosol Module (HAM) and discuss how we cope with three associated computational challenges: the high dimensionality of the parameter space, the substantial year-to-year variability of the model climate as compared to the long term mean climate, and response time scales to changes in tuning parameters that range from under a year to several centuries or longer.

The stochastic approximation method is behind the solution of many actively-studied problems in PDE-constrained optimization. Despite its far-reaching applications, there is almost no work on applying stochastic approximation and interior-point optimization, although IPM are particularly efficient in large-scale nonlinear optimization due to their attractive worst-case complexity. We present a massively parallel stochastic IPM method and apply it to stochastic PDE problems such as boundary control and optimization of complex electric power grid systems under uncertainty.

Co-authors: Marcus Mohr (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany); Ulrich Rüde (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany); Markus Wittmann (FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg / Erlangen Regional Computing Center (RRZE), Germany); Barbara Wohlmuth (Technical University of Munich, Germany)
In many scientific and engineering applications one has to deal with curved geometries. Such domains can accurately be approximated e.g., by unstructured grids and iso-parametric finite elements. We present a novel approach here that is well-suited to our concept of hierarchical hybrid grids (HHG). The latter was shown to achieve excellent performance and scalability even for extreme numbers of DOFs by a matrix-free implementation and exploiting regularity of access patterns. In our approach FE stencils are not assembled exactly, but approximated by low order polynomials and evaluated with an efficient incremental algorithm. We demonstrate the accuracy achieved as well as the computational efficiency using our prototypical HHG-based mantle convection solver which operates on non-nested triangulations of a thick spherical shell. The implementation of our scheme is based on a systematic node-level performance analysis and maintains the high efficiency of the original HHG.

Co-authors:
This work introduces a code which solves a diffusion-reaction problem using a Discontinuous Galerkin method. We have designed this code in order to exploit the full potential of GPU architectures. The sparse matrix-vector product, fundamental in iterative solvers, is a critical point for GPUs.   The locality of Discontinuous Galerkin methods let us implement the stiffness matrix-vector product as a stencil code. The "actions" of local operators are applied directly to the vector of the global degrees of freedom. The implementation is matrix-free; only the vectors of the degrees of freedom and the mesh data are stored in the GPU memory.   Our stiffness matrix-vector product implementation has shown good scalability on CSCS's Piz Daint system.   The code has been developed as a master thesis project by Paolo Gorlani. The thesis supervisors are Prof.ssa P. F. Antonietti and Prof. L. Bonaventura, both from MOX.

The simulation of fluids exhibiting non-isothermal and non-Newtonian behavior is of great relevance to a multitude of industrial applications. However, setting up discretization and solver components as well as parallelizing and optimizing involved code is quite challenging. One possible remedy is using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in conjunction with code generation techniques, as pursued by project ExaStencils.   In this work, we present our advances in fully generating solvers for such fluid flow problems from an abstract representation. In detail, we examine a finite volume discretization of Navier-Stokes and temperature equations on a non-uniform staggered grid which is treated using the SIMPLE algorithm and geometric multigrid solvers. This complex application brings new challenges, mainly considering automatically applied optimizations, but also many possibilities to enhance employed DSLs and, thus, greatly facilitate design and implementation processes. We discuss these points in depth and provide convincing performance results for fully generated and automatically parallelized solvers.

It comprises eight partners from academia and industry and is coordinated by University College Cork. The objective of the project is to create a new way of provisioning heterogeneous cloud resources to deliver cloud services on the principles of self-management and self-organisation. This new self-organising system will make the cloud more accessible to cloud consumers and provide cloud service providers with power-efficient, scalable management of their cloud infrastructures. The CloudLightning solution will be demonstrated in three application domains: i) Genome Processing; ii) Oil and Gas exploration; and iii) Ray Tracing. Expected impacts for European cloud service providers include increased competitiveness through reduced cost and differentiation;  increased energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact; improved service delivery; and greater accessibility to cloud computing for high performance computing workloads.

dCUDA: Hardware Supported Overlap of Computation and Communication , Tobias Gysi (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Jeremia Bär (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Torsten Hoefler (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
In recent years, the CUDA programming model and underlying GPU hardware architecture have gained a lot of popularity in various application domains such as climate modelling, computational chemistry, and machine learning. Today, GPU cluster programming typically requires two different programming models that separately deal with on-node computation and inter-node communication. With dCUDA we present a unified GPU cluster programming model that implements device-side remote memory access operations with target notification. To hide instruction pipeline latencies, CUDA programs over-subscribe the hardware with many more threads than there are execution units. Whenever a thread stalls the hardware proceeds with another thread that is ready for execution. To make best use of the cluster interconnect, dCUDA applies the same latency hiding technique to automatically overlap on-node computation with inter-node communication. Our experiments demonstrate good and perfect overlap for compute-bound and memory-bound tasks respectively.

Rough boundaries impose several challenges to fluid simulations. Their difficulty stems from the fact that resolving the small scale rough geometry requires significantly refined meshes in the vicinity of the boundaries. Since all physical rough boundaries have a characteristic length, scale corrections on the standard Navier-Stokes equations can be obtained by considering Taylor expansions around the rough surface, leading to modified boundary conditions. Numerical tests are presented to validate the proposed theory including the calculation of drag and lift coefficients for laminar flow around a cylinder with rough boundary.   Key-words: steady state Navier-Stokes equations, periodic rough boundaries, drag and lift coefficients, laminar flow.

Fast Randomized Algorithms for Covariance Matrix Computations , Pierre Blanchard (INRIA, France)
Co-authors: Olivier Coulaud (INRIA, France); Eric Darve (Stanford University, United States of America); Alain Franc (INRIA, France)
Covariance matrices arise in many fields of modern scientific computation from geostatistics to data analysis, where they usually measure the correlation between grid points. Most algorithms involving such matrices have a superlinear cost in N, the size of the grid. We present an open-source library implementing efficient algorithms based on randomized low-rank approximations (LRA). The library can provide approximate decompositions of low-rank covariance matrices in O(N^2) operations instead of the usual O(N^3) cost of standard methods. In addition, low-rank covariance matrices given as kernels, e.g., Gaussian functions, and evaluated on 3D grids can be factorized in O(N) operations using randomized LRA and an FMM acceleration. The performance of the library is illustrated on two examples: the generation of Gaussian Random Fields on large O(10^6) points heterogeneous spatial grids, and the computation of reduced-order maps given distances between DNA sequences using Multi-Dimensional Scaling for the classification of species on 10^5 samples.

Hash Tables on GPUs Using Lock-Free Linked Lists , Andreas Jocksch (ETH Zurich / CSCS, Switzerland)

Hash table implementations which resolve collisions by chaining with linked lists are very flexible with respect to the insertion of additional keys to an existing table and to the deletion of a part of the keys from it. For our implementation on GPUs, we use non-blocking linked lists based on atomic "compare and swap" operations. The deletion of list entries is done by declaring them as invalid and removing them. Typically, after a couple of deletion operations, our local heap is compacted. Using this approach, the initial build of the hash table and hash lookups perform comparably to the CUDPP library implementation. However, small modifications of the table are performed much faster in our implementation than the complete rebuild required by other implementations. We intend to use this novel hash table implementation for astrophysical GPU simulations with adaptive mesh particle-in-cell, which would benefit greatly from these new features.

Sequential programs compiled for today's heterogeneous hardware often exploit only a small fraction of available compute resources. To benefit of GPU accelerators the use of explicit parallel programming languages, pragma annotation systems, or specialized code generators is commonly necessary. We address the problem of automatically generating GPU code by developing a newly integrated heterogeneous compute compiler which - using latest polyhedral modeling techniques - automatically maps sequential programs to accelerators. For a range of applications we observe almost no performance regressions. On top of this baseline, we report performance improvements for a multiple computer kernels as well as two application benchmarks from SPEC CPU 2006.

SPH-flow is the one of the most advanced SPH solvers dedicated to high dynamic multiphase physics simulations. Over the last year, ECNantes has partnered with Nextflow-Software to deliver an accelerated version of the code on Piz Daint. This poster will present the results of this development activity.   After assessing the overall performance of the code, we focused on the Monaghan solver. We investigated strategies to improve its performance for an efficient execution on CPUs as well as GPUs, maintaining the scalability of the MPI version and high programmability. The keys to our incremental successes were being able to run a reduced version of the code, data types refactoring and workarounds for the limitations of the compilers.   This work should be of interest to academic developers because it details our experience using OpenACC directives for scientific computing in an area of cutting edge research.

The application of the local part of the effective potential to the wave-functions is one of the known bottlenecks of the plane-wave pseudopotential codes. The reason for this is the underlying FFT kernel which is traditionally parallelized over the maximum available number of MPI ranks. Alternatively, the FFT kernel can be implemented on a two-dimensional MPI grid where row ranks take care of individual FFTs and column ranks are used for band parallelization. The 2D MPI grid approach to the FFT kernel and its performance are discussed in this work.

The novel non-stationary approach to causality inference of multivariate time-series was proposed during the recent research of project participants. This methodology uses the clustering based on a minimization of the averaged clustering functional, which describes the mean distance between observation data and its representation in terms of given number of abstract Bayesian causality models of a certain predefined class. For analysis of realistic datasets we develop HPC library that is built on top of PETSc and that implements MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA parallelization strategies. We present the mathematical aspects of the methodology and preliminary results of solving the non-stationary problem of causality inference for multivariate economic data with our HPC approach. The results are computed on Piz Daint at CSCS.

This project explores a technique called High-Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR), which allows for the decomposition of a function into a finite number of lower-dimensional component functions. HDMR leverages the lack of input correlation to effectively reduce dimensionality of the problem in exchange for accuracy. Due to the intrinsic separability and hierarchical construction, HDMR provides the opportunity for both embarrassingly parallel model estimation and adaptive selection of active or significant inputs. An application of HDMR in conjunction with Adaptive Sparse Grids is shown in the context of computational economics, in which we provide an efficient solution method for high-dimensional dynamic stochastic models. Our results show that HDMR can effectively capture model dynamics with relatively low-dimensional component functions, thus mitigating the so-called "curse of dimensionality" and allowing for computability of larger systems.

Deep learning is a recent predictive modelling approach which yields near-human performance on a range of tasks. Deep learning language models have gained popularity as they achieved state-of-the-art results in many language tasks, such as language translation, but are computationally intensive thus requiring computers with accelerators and weeks of computation time. Here we propose a parallel algorithm for running deep learning language models on hundreds of nodes equipped with Xeon Phis to reduce the computation time to mere hours. We use MPI for the parallelization among nodes and use Xeon Phis to accelerate the matrix multiplications which make up more than 75% of the total computation. With our algorithm experimentation can be done much faster thus enabling rapid progress in the sparsely explored domain of natural language understanding.

As information and communication technologies continue to expand, the need arises to develop analytical strategies capable of accommodating new and larger sets of social network data. Considerable attention has recently been dedicated to the possibility of scaling exponential random graph models (ERGMs) - a well-established family of statistical models - for analyzing large social networks. Efficient computational methods would be highly desirable in order to extend the empirical scope of ERGM for the analysis of large social networks. We report preliminary results of a research project on the development of new sampling methods for ERGMs. We propose a new MCMC sampler and use it with Metropolis coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo, a typical scheme for MCMC parallelization. We show that, using this method, the CPU time for parameter estimation may be considerably reduced.   *Generous support from the Swiss National Platform of Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) is gratefully acknowledged.

Signal transduction across cellular membranes is controlled by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is widely accepted that members of the GPCR family self-assemble as dimers or higher-order structures being functional units in the plasma membrane. The chemokines receptors are GPCRs implicated in a wide range of physiological and non-physiological cell processes. These receptors represent prime targets for therapeutic intervention in a wide spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, cancer and HIV. The CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors are two of the manly studied playing crucial roles in different pathologies. In this scenario the use of computational techniques able to describe complex biological processes such as protein dimerization acquires a great importance. Combining coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics (MetaD) we are able to describe the mechanism of dimer formation, capturing multiple association and dissociation events allowing to compute a detailed free energy landscape of the process.

Mass spectrometer (MS) based data-independent acquisition with targeted analysis offers new possibilities for highly multiplexed peptide and protein quantification experiments. This type of analysis often includes a spectral library as a prerequisite. In layman's terms, a spectral library is a collection of fingerprints that facilitates the identification of signals measured by the MS. Both the size and the quality of a spectral library, acting as a template for these target signals, can make a significant difference in the quality of the data analysis.   Recently, the trend has been moving towards generating very large spectral libraries consisting of hundreds of thousands of peptides stemming from tens of thousands of proteins. From a software engineering perspective, the challenge then is to process and manage such large libraries in an efficient manner. Here we present our solution towards generating very large spectral libraries while using a standard gaming workstation.

Immersed boundary methods have become the most usable and useful tools for simulation of biomedical fluid-structure interaction, e.g., in the aortic valve of human heart. In such problems, complex geometry and motion of the soft tissue impose significant computational cost for bodyfitted-mesh methods. Resorting to a fixed Eulerian grid for the flow simulation along with the immersed boundary method to model the interaction with the soft tissue eliminates the expensive mesh generation and updating costs. Nevertheless, the computational cost for the geometry operations including adaptive search algorithms are still significant. Herein, we implemented the immersed boundary kernels with CUDA to be transferred and executed on thousands of parallel threads on the general purpose GPU. Host-device memory optimisation along with optimal usage of GPU multiprocessors results in a boosted performance in fluid-structure interaction simulations.

The Blue Brain Project (BBP) and the Human Brain Project aim to improve our understanding of the human brain through data-driven modelling and whole brain simulation. Advanced computing technologies enable such projects to study problems that were unmanageable until recently. Care must be taken in the development process to ensure that the software developed is usable and maintainable over the project lifetime. Best practices range from documentation, code review, continuous integration, test coverage, to functional and integration testing. While common in industrial environments, these best practices are not yet common in more academic scientific projects.   Within the BBP, we are developing scientific software to synthesize biologically realistic neuronal morphologies for large-scale brain simulations. We discuss how best practices are applied in different stages of our scientific software development process. We show how validation drives the development of increasingly complex models and demonstrate how modular design benefits future use through examples.

Replica-Exchange Enveloping Distribution Sampling: A Robust and Accurate Method to Calculate Multiple Free Energy Differences from a Single Simulation , Dominik Sidler (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Sereina Z. Riniker (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) presents an attractive alternative to standard methods for the calculation of free-energy differences ∆G from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, as it allows the estimation of ∆G between multiple states from a single simulation of a reference state R. The challenge of the approach is the determination of optimal parameters for R to ensure equal sampling of all end states. While an automatic selection procedure is available for two end states, the determination of optimal R-parameters for multiple end states is currently an unsolved issue. To address this, we have generalized the replica-exchange EDS (RE-EDS) methodology, previously developed for constant-pH MD. By exchanging configurations between replicas with different R-parameters, major parts of the parameter-choice problem can be circumvented, resulting in a reliable, robust and accurate method. We have evaluated RE-EDS using a test system with five inhibitors of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) studied previously.

The membrane permeability of cyclic peptides is likely influenced by the conformational behavior of these compounds in polar and apolar environments. The size and complexity of peptides often limits their bioavailability, but there are known examples of peptide natural products such as cyclosporin A (CsA) that can cross cell membranes by passive diffusion. The crystal of CsA structure shows a "closed" conformation with four intramolecular hydrogen bonds. When binding to its target cyclophilin, CsA adopts an "open" conformation without intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In this study, we attempted to sample exhaustively the conformational space of CsA in chloroform and in water by molecular dynamics simulations in order to rationalize the good membrane permeability of CsA observed experimentally. From 10 μs molecular dynamics simulations in each solvent, Markov state models were constructed to characterize the metastable conformational states. The conformational landscapes in both solvents show significant overlap, but also clearly distinct features.

The Importance of N-Methylations for the Stability of the β6.3-Helical Conformation of Polytheonamide B , Annick V. Renevey (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Sereina Z. Riniker (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Polytheonamide B (PTB) is a highly cytotoxic transmembrane cation channel consisting of 49 residues, of which more than half are posttranslationally modified. Epimerizations result in alternating L- and D- amino acids allowing the peptide to adopt a β-helical structure stable in solution. The role of the other posttranslational modifications (PTMs): hydroxylations, side chain C-methylations and side chain N-methylations, is less understood. The importance of these PTMs for the β6.3-helical structure is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Groups or individual modified residues are reverted to their precursor amino acids and the conformational effect on PTB monitored. The simulation results indicate that the N-methylations are crucial for the stability of the β6.3-helix due to the formation of the side chain?side chain hydrogen bond chains that act like an "exoskeleton" for the helix. With unmethylated asparagine residues, the H-bond chains are unstable in polar solvents, resulting in the loss of the helical structure.

The UniProt knowledgebase is a leading resource of protein sequences and functional information whose centerpiece is the expert-curated Swiss-Prot section. UniProt data is accessible at www.uniprot.org (via a user-friendly interface and a REST API) and at sparql.uniprot.org, a public SPARQL endpoint hosted and maintained by the Vital-IT and Swiss-Prot groups of SIB. With 21 billion RDF triples it is the largest free to use graph database in the sciences. SPARQL allows scientists to perform complex queries within UniProt and across datasets located on remote SPARQL endpoints. It provides a free data integration solution for users who cannot afford to create custom data warehouses, at a cost for the service providers. Here we discuss the challenges in maintaining the UniProt SPARQL endpoint, which is updated monthly in sync with the UniProt data releases.

We present a Poisson solver with main applications in ab-initio simulations of nanoelectronic devices. The solver employs a plane-wave (Fourier) based pseudospectral approach and is capable of solving the generalized Poisson equation with a position-dependent dielectric constant subject to periodic or homogeneous Neumann conditions on the boundaries of the simulation cell and Dirichlet type conditions imposed at arbitrary subdomains. Any sufficiently smooth function modelling the dielectric constant, including density dependent dielectric continuum models can be utilized. Furthermore, for all the boundary conditions, consistent derivatives are available allowing for energy conserving molecular dynamics simulations.

A graphical-representation of a database[1] of more than 7000 molecules containing non-homogeneous mix of C, N, O and S atoms has been generated using a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm (sketch-map[2]) so that molecules with similar composition and geometry are projected close to each other.   The underlying metric is based on the REMatch-SOAP kernel[3], which is built upon a comparison of local environments[4], and treats the "alchemical" similarity between molecules, and the location of atoms in space, on the same footings. Much like in a periodic table, one can also recognize strong correlations between the positions of the molecules on the map and their physical-chemical properties, from formation energy to polarizability.  References: [1] G.

The computational study of chemical reactions in complex, wet environments is critical for applications in many fields. It is often essential to study chemical reactions at the ab-initio level in the presence of the proper electrochemical environment. In this work we present a continuum solvation library able to handle both neutral and ionic solutions, solving the Generalized Poisson and the Poisson-Boltzmann problem. Two different recipes have been implemented to build up the continuum dielectric cavity (one using atomic coordinates, the other mapping the solute electronic density). A preconditioned conjugate gradient method has been implemented for the Generalized Poisson equation, whilst a self-consistent procedure enables us to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann problem. Both solvers and continuum dielectric cavities have been integrated into the BigDFT electronic-structure package. We benchmarked the whole library on several atomistic systems including small neutral molecules, large proteins, solvated surfaces and reactions in solution to demonstrate efficiency and performances.

One of the goals of the PASC project is to strengthen the networking in the Swiss material science community through active development of collaborative relationships among University researchers and CSCS staff. This includes assisting researchers in tuning, debugging, optimizing, and enhancing codes and applications for HPC resources, from mid-scale to national and international petascale facilities, with a view to the exascale transition. In addition, the application support specialists provide support for development projects on software porting techniques, parallelization and optimization strategies, deployment on diverse computational platforms, and data management.   Here we present selected tools and software developed for CP2K [1]. Furthermore we show exemplary how a CP2K application can be tuned to optimally use all available HPC resources.

Herringbone Reconstruction versus Adsorption Registry: Which One Matters More to Pyrphyrin Adsorption , Yeliz Gurdal (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Marcella Iannuzzi (University of Zurich, Switzerland); Juerg Hutter (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Understanding molecule-metal interfaces is crucial in current technologies such as molecular electronics, magnetism, and photovoltaic cells. However, due to the complex nature of Au(111) surface which possesses herringbone reconstruction, the interactions between molecules and the reconstructed Au(111) surface are still unclear. To fill this fundamental gap in the literature we apply Density Functional Theory to investigate the effects of both herringbone reconstruction and adsorption registry on the electronic structure of Co-Pyrphyrin(CoPy)@Au(111) complex. We found that the type of van der Waals schemes is important to get accurate herringbone structure of the Au(111) surface. Adsorption of the molecule is stabilized by the interaction of both Co metal center and cyano groups with under-coordinated Au atoms. PDOS analysis reveals that CoPy@Au(111) interface is influenced more by changing adsorption registry of the molecule rather than changing adsorption domains on the herringbone reconstructed surface.

With the available computational power growing, ever larger systems can be investigated with increasingly advanced methods and new algorithms. For electronic structure calculations on systems containing a few thousand atoms, linear scaling algorithms are essential. For ground state DFT calculations, linear scaling has already been demonstrated for millions of atoms in the condensed phase [J. VandeVondele, U. Bortnik, J. Hutter, 2012]. Here, we extend this work to electronically excited states, for example, to make UV/VIS spectroscopy or investigations of the electron injection process in dye-sensitized solar cells possible. We base our approach on non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, in particular on Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (EMD). The formalism, based on the density matrix, allows for linear scaling based on the sparsity of the density matrix and naturally incorporates density embedding methods such as the Kim-Gordon approach.

Nuclear Quantum Effects on Calculated Aqueous Redox Properties , Vladimir Rybkin (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors:
Nuclear quantum effects neglected in most applications have been recently shown to have a significant influence on the calculated band structures of bulk liquids and solids and might thus be very significant for electrochemical properties. We have calculated thermodynamic integrals as well as vertical ionization potentials (VIP) and vertical electron affinities (VEA) for two redox pairs, CO2/CO2- and HO2/HO2-, using DFT-driven thermodynamic integration using the classical and the quantum generalized Langevin equation colored-noise thermostats. It has been found that quantum nuclear effects lead to noticeable shifts in both VIP and VEA: the former is reduced, whereas the latter is increased for both pairs. As a consequence, significant effect cancellation is observed for the thermodynamic integrals computed with the classical and the quantum thermostats.

Probing Defects and Correlations in the Hydrogen-Bond Network of Ab Initio Water , Piero Gasparotto (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-authors:
Many of the unique properties of water are due to its highly-structured hydrogen-bond (HB) network, in which a dominant tetrahedral motif coexists with a plethora of different coordination defects. Due to structural constraints, coordination defects do not come alone, but clustered together. Here, we compute defect-resolved distribution functions from ab initio molecular dynamics to probe the radial and angular correlation between defects. We shed light on how fluctuations from the ideal tetrahedral structure contribute to the total radial distribution function of liquid water. We also present a systematic comparison of the concentration of different defects and the structural correlations between them, with a variety of simulation protocols. We show that regardless the details of the model, the qualitative predictions for the defect distributions are very similar. The most significant effect can be attributed to dispersion interactions, that impact the most on the relative populations of the various defects.

The key operation for linear scaling DFT implemented in the CP2K quantum chemistry program is sparse matrix-matrix multiplication. For such a task, the sparse matrix library DBCSR (Distributed Block Compressed Sparse Row) has been developed. DBCSR takes full advantage of the block-structured sparse nature of the matrices for efficient computation and communication. It is MPI and OpenMP parallelized, and can exploit accelerators. We describe a strategy to improve DBCSR performance. DBCSR is available as a stand alone library at http://dbcsr.cp2k.org/ to be employed in electronic structure codes. To this end a streamlined API has been defined and a suite of tools has been developed to generate the full documentation of the library (API-DOC) by extracting the information provided directly in the source code. We give a flavour of the generated API-DOC by showing snapshots of selected HTML documentation pages and we sketch the design of such tools.

What Influences the Water Oxidation Activity of a Bio-Inspired Molecular CoII4O4 Cubane? , Florian Hodel (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Sandra Luber (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
We investigated the reaction mechanism of the recently presented first Co(II)-based WOC, [CoII4(hmp)4(μ-OAc)2(μ2-OAc)2(H2O)2] (hmp=2-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine), which is one of the rare stable homogeneous cubane-type water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) and the design of which has been inspired by nature's oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII). Two possible different catalytic cycles have been envisioned: A single-site pathway involving only one cobalt center and a water attack on an oxo ligand or, alternatively, an oxo-oxo coupling pathway where two terminal oxo ligands of the cubane couple and are released as O2. Using density functional theory and an explicit first solvation shell, we compare relative free energies of all catalytic states and analyze their stability and reactivity. Furthermore, we compute barriers and reaction paths for the water attack and O2 release steps. With this knowledge at hand, we propose possibilities to tune catalytic activity paving the way to informed design of high-performance PSII mimics.

We report on the status of the "DIAPHANE'" PASC project. The library contains modules to model the physical processes for energy transport by radiation and neutrinos that are most important for astrophysics. A common API is used to access each algorithm. The capability to model simultaneously multiple algorithms enables a wide range of new simulations such as, for example, the heating of gas by a stellar source and diffusion of that energy into a surrounding gas disk or nebula. Astrophysics applications include: supernovae; the formation of planets, black holes, stars, and galaxies. We demonstrate the current functionality and discuss some of the challenges and strategies in making the library modular, portable, and efficient for current and future HPC architectures.

We present recent developments of GBS, a simulation code used to evolve plasma turbulence in the edge of fusion devices. GBS solves a set of 3D fluid equations, the Poisson and the Ampere equation, and a kinetic equation for the neutral atoms. Investigations carried out with GBS have significantly advanced our understanding of the plasma dynamics at the edge of fusion devices. For example, GBS simulations allowed the identification of the turbulent regimes and the saturation mechanisms of the linearly unstable modes. In GBS, a 3D Cartesian MPI communicator is employed, leading to excellent parallel scalability up to 8192 cores. To efficiently exploit many-core and hybrid architectures, new schemes using MPI+OpenMP and MPI+OpenACC have been recently implemented. We show the implementation of the new parallelization schemes, their scalability, and their efficiency. The new parallelization allows the efficient use of advanced hybrid supercomputers, such as Piz Daint at CSCS.

The supercomputing platforms available for high performance computing based research evolve at a great rate. However, this rapid development of novel technologies requires adaptations and optimizations of the existing codes for each new machine architecture. In such context, minimizing time of efficiently porting the code on a new platform is of crucial importance. A possible solution is to use coarse grain simulations of the application that can assist in detecting performance bottlenecks. We present a procedure of implementing the intermediate profiling for openQCD code[1] that will enable the global reduction of the cost of profiling and optimizing this code commonly used in the lattice QCD community. Our approach is based on well-known SimGrid simulator[2], which allows for fast and accurate performance predictions of the codes on HPC architectures. Additionally, accurate estimations of the program behavior on some future machines, not yet accessible to us, are anticipated.   [1] http://luscher.web.cern.ch/luscher/openQCD/   [2] http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/

In view of applications to magnetohydrodynamic models of the solar atmosphere, we have developed a new method for integrating the equation of radiative transfer for polarized light across a discontinuous atmosphere, using piecewise continuous reconstruction and slope limiters. In this poster, we present a comparison of results obtained with our new method and with more conventional methods.

Coupling Geodynamic Seismic Cycle and Dynamic Rupture Models , Iris van Zelst (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors: Ylona van Dinther (ETH Zurich, Switzerland); Alice-Agnes Gabriel (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany)
Diverse modelling techniques that span large spatial and temporal scales are required to study the seismicity in subduction zones. Our seismo-thermo-mechanical (STM) seismic cycle models solve million year scale subduction dynamics and multiple earthquake events self-consistently, but fail to resolve the finer seismic time scale at which dynamic rupture models excel. By using the self-consistent stresses and strengths of our STM model as input for dynamic rupture scenarios conducted with SeisSol, the otherwise hard-to-constrain assumptions on these fields are resolved and advantages of both methods are exploited. The results show that a dynamic rupture can be triggered spontaneously and that the propagating rupture is qualitatively comparable to its quasi-static equivalent. The importance of both self-consistent initial conditions and dynamic feedback on fault strength is illustrated by a quantitative comparison of surface displacements and stresses.

Flexible Automatic Discretization for Finite Differences: Eliminating the Human Factor , Casper Pranger (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors:
In the geophysical numerical modelling community, finite differences are (in part due to their small footprint) a popular spatial discretization method for PDEs in the regular-shaped continuum that is the earth. However, they rapidly become prone to programming mistakes when physics increase in complexity. To eliminate opportunities for human error, we have designed an automatic discretization algorithm using Wolfram Mathematica, in which the user supplies symbolic PDEs, the number of spatial dimensions, and a choice of symbolic boundary conditions, and the script transforms this information into matrix- and right-hand-side rules ready for use in a C++ code that will accept them. The symbolic PDEs are further used to automatically develop and perform manufactured solution benchmarks, ensuring at all stages physical fidelity while providing pragmatic targets for numerical accuracy. We find that this procedure greatly accelerates code development and provides a great deal of flexibility in ones choice of physics.

Poroelastic theory is essential in many geophysical applications such as imaging fluid-flow in oil reservoirs, monitoring the storage of CO2, and most topics in hydrogeology etc. Biot formulated the poroelastic wave equation in fully-saturated media. Based on Biot's theory, we aim to image the fluid directly in a regional seismic exploration setting. We simulate wave propagation in poroelastic media using a spectral element method. We define several misfit functionals and use adjoint methods to calculate the corresponding sensitivity kernels. The adjoint method is an efficient way for computing the gradient of a misfit functional with respect to the model parameters, and is based on the interaction between the time-reversed regular and adjoint field. Using those kernels, we perform gradient-based iterative inversions. We investigate in how far a poroelastic theory is effective for imaging the fluids, and study the influence of bulk properties, porosity, permeability and fluid-solid interaction on the results.

The explicit treatment of inertial waves imposes a very small timestep in dynamo simulations at low Ekman number. We present a fully spectral Chebyshev tau method that allows us to treat the inertial waves implicitly. The large linear systems that need to be solved at each timestep remain affordable thanks to the sparsity of the formulation. The simulations are parallelised using a 2D data decomposition for the nonlinear calculations combined with a parallel linear solver for the timestepping. Despite the increased complexity, significant gains in wall-clock time are achieved thanks to larger timesteps.

Optimal Utilisation of Piz Daint Memory Bandwidth for a Parallel GPU Two-Phase Solver , Ludovic Raess (University of Lausanne, Switzerland)

Massively parallel algorithms are commonly based on iterative methods. Such algorithms may run with optimal performance on very large systems, such the Cray XC30 Piz Daint at CSCS. The iterative methods require typically few calculations per transferred floating point number (low flop to byte ratio), and are therefore normally memory throughput bound. We developed a parallel GPU Two-Phase Hydro-Mechanical solver to resolve nonlinear fluid flow in transforming porous media. The key point for maximum performance is to optimally use the hardware's memory bandwidth when performing the minimum amount of memory accesses needed to solve the coupled equations. We show promising results of single GPU memory throughput close to memory copy values (i.e. when no computation is done), and optimal parallel efficiency and a linear scaling up to 5000 GPU nodes, i.e. the entire Piz Daint machine.

Co-authors:
Atomistic computer simulations give access to increasingly accurate and predictive modelling of materials, chemical and biochemical compounds. As more complex systems become amenable to computation, the sheer amount of data produced by a simulation, as well as its intrinsic structural complexity, make it harder to extract physical insight from modelling. I will discuss how to build a robust, effective metric to compare molecules and condensed-phase structures, and how this can be used to represent large databases of compounds, building intuitive maps of chemical landscapes and singling out outliers and anomalous conformations. Furthermore, I will demonstrate the potential of this approach to machine-learn the physical-chemical properties of such compounds, that promises to circumvent the need for expensive quantum chemical calculations.

To simulate advanced electronic devices such as nanoscale transistors or memory cells whose functionality may depend on the position of single atoms only, a quantum transport solver is needed, which should not only be capable of atomic scale resolution, but also to deal with systems consisting of thousands to a hundred thousands atoms. The device simulator OMEN and the electronic structure code CP2K have been united to perform ab initio quantum transport calculations on the level of density functional theory. To take full advantage of modern hybrid supercomputer architectures, new algorithms have been developed and implemented. They allow for the simultaneous computation of open boundary conditions in parallel on the available CPUs and the solution of the Schrödinger equation in a scalable way on the GPUs. The main concepts behind the algorithms will be presented and results for realistic nanostructures will be shown.

Parallel Eigensolvers for Plane-Wave Density Functional Theory , Antoine Levitt (INRIA, France)
Co-authors:
Density functional theory (DFT) approximates the Schrödinger equation by modelling electronic correlation as a function of density. Its relatively modest O(N^3) scaling makes it the standard method in electronic structure computation for condensed phases containing up to thousands of atoms. Computationally, its bottleneck is the partial diagonalisation of a Hamiltonian operator, which is usually not formed explicitly. Using the example of the Abinit code, I will discuss the challenges involved in scaling plane-wave DFT computations to petascale supercomputers, and show how the implementation of a new method based on Chebyshev filtering results in good parallel behaviour up to tens of thousands of processors. I will also discuss some open problems in the numerical analysis of eigensolvers and extrapolation methods used to accelerate the convergence of fixed point iterations.

Diffusion Mechanisms in Li0.5CoO2: A Computational Study , Teutë Bunjaku (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors:
The diffusion coefficient of Li-ions is one of the key parameters in the design of high performance Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and defines a strict upper bound for how fast Li-ions can be inserted or extracted from the electrodes. In this talk, through accurate atomistic simulations, we will study the order effects occurring in half filled layers of LiCoO2 and propose an explanation for the experimentally observed dip in the Li diffusivity at this concentration. Surprisingly, it is found that the lowest energy phase of Li0.5CoO2 is a zig-zag pattern rather than the currently assumed linear arrangement and the diffusion in this phase is highly anisotropic, thus explaining the observed dip in the diffusivity. The atomic interactions are modeled at the density-functional theory level of accuracy and energy barriers for Li-ion diffusion are determined from searches for first order saddle points on the resulting potential energy surface.

Graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges (ZGNRs) show a great potential for use in spintronics devices [Geim et al., 2007]. We report a synthesis of atomically precise ZGNRs through a bottom-up approach on Au(111) surface [Pascal et al., 2016]. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal the existence of edge-localized-states in pristine and phenyl-functionalized ZGNRs. Using density functional theory calculations we show that such functionalization preserves the electronic properties of pristine ZGNR with a reduction in the energy gap which renders edge magnetism unstable to environmental influences. Furthermore, broken translational symmetry along the zigzag edge splits the two edge states into four. Magnetic instability is evident while modelling ZGNRs adsorbed on Au(111). A change in the van der Waals parameterization leads to decrease in the net magnetization and frontier states inversion at the Fermi level. Our findings show that an appropriate precursor molecule provides a route to engineering the electronic structure of ZGNRs.

Erosion damage in hydraulic turbines is a common problem caused by the high-velocity impact of small particles entrained in the fluid. Numerical simulations can be useful to investigate the effect of each governing parameter in this complex phenomenon. The Finite Volume Particle Method is used to simulate the three-dimensional impact of dozens of rigid spherical particles on a metallic surface. The very fine discretization and the overall number of time steps needed to achieve the steady state erosion rate render the problem very expensive, implying the need for high performance computing. In this talk, a comparison of constitutive models is presented, with the aim of assessing the complexity of the thermomechanical modelling required to accurately simulate the impact and subsequent erosion of metals. The importance of strain rate, triaxiality, friction model and thermal effects is discussed.

Co-authors:
The demand of more energy combined with the requirement of reducing greenhouse emissions has made the developing of new electronic devices challenging. Improvements in the efficiency of applications like solar-cells, light emitting devices or semi-conductors are then required. In this context the possibility of tuning their electronic properties make Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), which are crystalline materials that combine inorganic metals with organic ligands, interesting candidates for the next generations of electronic-devices. At present the main limitation in electro-active MOFs is that the valence and conduction bands are localised either on the inorganic or on the organic part restricting their potential usage for magnetism and/or conductivity in which electron mobility is required. In this work I will show how through a combinatorial analysis the delocalisation between the organic and inorganic part has been rationalised allowing the design of hybrid materials with high magnetic and conductive properties.

Local Density Fitting within a Gaussian and Plane Waves Approach: Accelerating Simulations Based on Density Functional Theory , Dorothea Golze (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Co-authors:
A local resolution-of-identity (LRI) is introduced for Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory calculations using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) approach within the CP2K program package. The locality of the density fitting ensures that the linear scaling of the GPW approach is retained, while the prefactor for calculating the KS matrix is drastically reduced. In LRIGPW, the atomic pair densities are approximated by an expansion in one-center fit functions. Thereby, the computational demands for the grid-based operations become negligible, while they are dominant for GPW. The LRI approach is assessed for a wide range of molecular and periodic systems yielding highly accurate results for reaction energies as well as intra- and intermolecular structure parameters. Employing LRI, the SCF step is sped up by a factor of 2-25 depending on the symmetry of the simulation cell, the grid cutoff and the system size.

Co-Authors:
Numerical simulations of lubricated contacts (as in roller bearings, came-follower systems, gears) will be discussed. Finite-Element models can reach a quantitative prediction of friction and lubricant film thickness, as soon as heat exchanges are properly described both in the lubricant and in a sufficiently large portion of the bounding solids, whose heat diffusion can have drastic consequence on both friction and wear. But temperature should be fixed at some places (where?, which value?). We will show that a multiscale analysis, taking into account the whole mechanism surrounding the contact, would be required. The other way around, a local description of molecules flowing between the surfaces (e.g. using molecular dynamics simulations) would require the thermostating of at least a part of the molecular domain. How to impose temperature in this tiny space without disrupting the flow? Again this multiscale thermal problem in tribology should be solved by an adequate modelling.

There are many situations where the discrete nature of matter needs to be accounted by numerical models. For instance with crystalline materials, friction and ductile fracture modelling can benefit from Molecular Dynamics formalism. However, capturing these processes needs sizes involving large number of particles, often becoming out of reach of modern computers. Thus, concurrent multiscale approaches have emerged to reduce the computational cost by using a coarser continuum model. The difference between particles and continuum leads to several challenging problems. In this presentation, finite temperatures, numerical stability and dislocation passing will be addressed. Also the software framework LibMultiScale will be presented with its associated parallel computation design choices.

Deformation and fracture processes in engineering materials often require simultaneous descriptions over a range of length and time scales, with each scale using a different computational technique. Here we discuss some of the available multiscale coupling algorithms and their most interesting features from an academic and a corporate research perspective. We then present a high-performance parallel 3D computing framework for executing large multiscale studies that couple an atomic domain, modeled using molecular dynamics and a continuum domain, modeled using explicit finite elements. The main purpose of this work is to provide a multiscale implementation within an existing large-scale parallel molecular dynamics code (LAMMPS) that enables use of all the tools associated with this popular open-source code, while extending the robust CADD-type displacement coupling to 3D. Our implementation allows us to reproduce results of extremely large atomistic simulations using fewer than 1,000,000 atoms, thus at a much lower computational cost.

Multiscale Modeling of Frank-Read Source ; Jaehyun Cho (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-Authors: Guillaume Anciaux (EPFL, Switzerland)
The strength of materials is mainly controlled by dislocations. Their dynamics include nucleations and multiplications at grain boundaries. Nonlinear atomistic forces should be considered to quantify nucleations, while, to correctly model dislocation pile-up, forces in far-fields are required. Atomistic (MD) and discrete dislocation (DD) simulations have been performed to study these dynamics. In MD, nucleations were naturally considered, but limitations of domain sizes persisted. In DD, dislocation interactions including pile-up were well described. However, ad-hoc approaches are required for nucleations. These limitations lead to couple these two method: CADD3D. In this talk, we present a multiscale model of a Frank-Read source using CADD3D. Several dislocations will be nucleated from the Frank-Read source in the MD zone, and develop as complete closed loops. As they approach the DD domain, they will be transformed as DD dislocations. An observable consequence will be work-hardening effects due to the pile-up back stresses.

Fracture remains one of the most challenging multi-scale modelling problems, requiring a concurrent description of the chemical processes occurring near a crack tip and the long range stress field driving it forward. This talk will discuss how these requirements can be met simultaneously by combining a quantum mechanical description of the crack tip with a classical atomistic model that captures the elastic behaviour of the surrounding crystal matrix, using a QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) approach such as the "Learn on the Fly" (LOTF) scheme. Strategies for the extension of this approach to provide effective constitutive laws at the continuum scale will be discussed, together with a recent information-efficient Machine Learning reformulation of the LOTF scheme, and finally if time permits some new work looking at how to couple QM and MM models using automatically derived site energies.
Applications and Algorithms for HPC in Solid Mechanics II: Multiscale Modelling
In all observable phenomena, a full understanding of the operative physical mechanisms leads to extremely complicated models. One natural analysis path is to decompose the problem into simpler sub-problems yet transferring part of the complexity to the issue of coupling the sub-problems. In the study of materials and solids, considerable progress has been made in the numerical methods to couple scales. For instance, atomic, discrete-defect, meso-scale, and structural scales can now be coupled together under various assumptions. In this minisymposium, talks are solicited to present new work on coupling strategies, their mathematical description, and/or their implementation details for possible HPC machines. Such multiscale methods could deal with multi-grid, FE², concurrent methods, particle-continuum coupling, among others. Other multiscale themes are also welcome in this minisymposium.

We discuss scalable solvers for the forward and inverse simulation of mantle flow problems. Crucial solver components for the arising nonlinear Stokes problems are parallel multigrid methods for preconditioning the linearized Stokes system, and a Schur complement approximation that is able to cope with extreme viscosity variations. To achieve good parallel scalability, we use, among others, matrix-free operations and we redistribute coarse multigrid levels to a subsets of all available processors. We will discuss the inversion of global rheology parameters and distributed fields from surface data and the present-day temperature distribution in instantaneous and time-dependent problems.

Laboratory experiments represent a great opportunity to study fundamental aspects of dynamic slip front propagation in a well-controlled system. Nevertheless, numerical simulations are needed to gain access to information that is experimentally unmeasurable but required to develop full understanding of the underlying mechanics. In this presentation, we discuss simulations that bridge two relevant scales for laboratory stick-slip experiments, which are the macroscopic structure and the meso-scale weakening process occurring at the interface. We show that these high-performance simulations reproduce quantitatively well experimental observations if both length scales are accurately modeled. Furthermore, we apply the acquired insights from the computational model to enable new experimental observations that are otherwise inaccessible, and to develop theoretical tools that are useful for the description and prediction of the mechanics of slip front propagation at frictional interfaces.

Lateral rupture limits substantially regulate the magnitude of great subduction megathrust earthquakes, but in turn, factors controlling it remain largely unknown due to the limited spatio-temporal range of observations. It however involves the long-term, regional tectonic history, including structural, stress and strength heterogeneities. This problem requires a powerful 3D-continuum numerical modelling approach that bridges tectonic and seismic timescales, but a suitable code is lacking. We demonstrate the development of a scalable PETSc-based staggered-grid finite difference code, in which self-consistent long-term deformation and spontaneous rupture are ensured through a solid-mechanics based visco-elasto-plastic rheology with a slip rate-dependent friction formulation, an energy-conservative inertial implementation, artificial damping of seismic waves at the domain boundaries, and an adaptive, implicit-explicit time-stepping scheme. Automated discretization and manufactured solution benchmarks ensure stability, flexibility and accuracy of the code at every stage of development.

The modelling of seismic elastic wave full waveform in a limited frequency band is now well established. The constant increase of computing power with time has now allowed the use of seismic elastic wave full waveforms in a limited frequency band to image the elastic properties of the earth. Nevertheless, inhomogeneities of scale much smaller than the minimum wavelength of the wavefield associated to the maximum frequency of the limited frequency band, are still a challenge for both forward and inverse problems. In this work, we tackle the problem of elastic properties varying much faster than the minimum wavelength, making it possible to link small and large scales for elastic or acoustic waves. Using a non periodic homogenization theory, we show how to compute effective elastic properties and local correctors. The implications of the homogenization theory on the inverse problem will be presented.

Numerical modelling of seismic wave propagation can be of great value at many scales, ranging from shallow applications in engineering geophysics to global scale seismology. Accurate modelling of the physics of wave propagation at different scales requires different spatial and temporal discretization and potentially also different numerical methods. We present a new method to dynamically link the waves propagating at these different scales. A finite-difference solver is used on a local grid, whereas the (much) larger background domain is represented by its (precomputed) Green's functions. At each time step of the simulation, the interaction between the events leaving the local domain and the medium outside is calculated using a Kirchhoff-type integral extrapolation and the extrapolated wavefield is applied as a boundary condition to the local domain. This results in a numerically exact hybrid modelling scheme, also after local updates of the model parameters.

Traditional three-dimensional modelling approaches to electromagnetic problems in geophysics work well in the cases when the resulting fields exhibit smooth variations on large spatial scales. However, the presence of highly conductive anomalies (e.g., metallic casing of the wells and other steel infrastructure) can affect the electromagnetic fields significantly. Extreme material contrasts and multiple spatial scales create serious computational challenges. Realistic interpretation of steel objects requires an extremely fine, millimeter-scale spatial discretization in a large computational domain whose size is of the order of tens of kilometers. Conductivity contrasts between steel and surrounding media can exceed 8-9 orders of magnitude. Even locally refined unstructured meshes lead to ill-conditioned problems with many millions of unknowns and hence require the use of high performance computing. In this presentation, I will give several examples of frequency-domain modelling scenarios when the presence of small-scale objects has a tremendous effect on electromagnetic measurements. 
Bridging Scales in Geosciences
Complex, but relevant processes within the Solid Earth domain cover a wide range of space and time scales, up to 17 and 26 orders of magnitude, respectively. Earthquake propagation, for instance, depends on dynamic processes at the rupture tip over 10^-9 seconds, while the plate tectonic faults on which they occur evolve over time scales up to 100's of millions of years. While problems in imaging and modelling of mantle processes on the Earth's tens of thousands of kilometers scale can be affected by physio-chemical compositions varying on a meter scale and being determined on a molecular level. Besides these examples ample of other physical processes in geophysics cross the largest imaginable scales. At each of the characteristic scales different physical processes are relevant, which thus requires us to couple the relevant physics at the different scales. Simulating the physics at each of these scales is a tremendous task, which hence often requires High Performance Computing. Computational challenges include, but are not limited to, a large number of degrees of freedom and crossing the two-scale problem on which most computational tools are founded. To discuss and start to tackle these challenges we aim to bring together computer and geoscientists to discuss them from different perspectives. Applications within geosciences, include, but or not limited to, geodynamics, seismology, fluid dynamics, tectonics, geomagnetism, and exploration geophysics.

Numerical simulation of particle-fluid interaction finds its importance in a wide range of applications like erosion and sedimentation, industrial filtering processes, or the study of volcanic plumes. As far as numerical simulation is concerned, the literature in this field is restricted to cases of low or moderate Reynolds numbers, or to examples in which the motion of the solid body is restricted or completely inhibited (example: the numerical simulation of particle settling at low Reynolds number, dominated by the particle-ground interaction). This presentation introduces a new numerical method which overcomes these limitations and resolves the coupled fluid-solid motion in a higher-Reynolds regime. It focuses on the free fall, in air, of particles with a diameter of several millimeters. A major difficulty stems from the fact that the particles typically reach a terminal velocity around 20 m/s and a Reynolds number around 50,000, at which fluid turbulence is fully developed.

Biological modelling has become an important approach to study the evolution of genes and organisms. However, the increase in availability of large-scale genomic data is pushing for the development of high-performance computing approaches to model evolutionary processes. In this context, the availability of Bayesian approaches has been essential to extend the realism of the evolutionary models that can be used. The development of these methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques is however computationally intensive and requires high-performance computing approaches to deal with the computational complexity. Here, I will present our recent developments to optimise and parallelize MCMC techniques. I will also discuss our efforts to extend modelling of adaptation from genomic data to complex phenotypic traits using hierarchical Bayesian computations.

Can we simulate haemodynamics in a vascular district in real time? One single heartbeat still takes several hours on an HPC platform, how can we reduce the computational complexity of 2-3 orders of magnitude? The key ingredients are model order reduction and numerical reduction combined with pre-processing on supercomputers. Blood flow in arteries needs to take into account the incompressibility of the fluid, the compliant vessel, and the patient specific data. After reducing the complexity of the model,i.e. by assuming a fixed fluid computational domain and a thin membrane structure, it is possible to use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Reduced Basis Method to split the computational effort into an offline and an online parts. The former runs on a HPC system in 5 hours on 1000 processors, while the latter runs in real time, i.e. 1 second of simulations in less than 1 second of CPU time, on a notebook.

Blood flow and the associated diseases in the cardiovascular system are fundamentally multiscale where events at the nano and micro-scale trigger problems in coronary and larger arteries as well as major arteries and heart valves. For example, atherothrombosis is a critical common event in heart attacks and strokes. The accumulation of platelets (1 to 2 micrometer) into a thrombus (few millimeters) has been shown to be dependent on hemodynamics, especially the local shear rate in arteries (2 to 10 millimeters). To induce arterial thrombosis, shear rate affects two biophysical factors: a) convection of circulating platelets to reach the thrombus surface (flux), and b) affinity of the surface to platelet binding. Any computational simulation must consider blood flow at the cellular level. We shall discuss progress and challenges in multiscale simulation of blood flow at cellular level with HPC as a fundamental platform for gaining insight in many cardiovascular processes.

At cellular resolution, the entities of neural networks are neurons and their connections, the synapses. Already early parallel simulation codes stored synapses in a distributed fashion such that a synapse solely consumes memory on the compute node harboring the target neuron. As petascale computers with some 100,000 nodes become increasingly available for neuroscience, new challenges arise: each neuron contacts on the order of 10,000 other neurons but for any given source neuron, at most a single synapse is typically created on a compute node. Here we present data structures taking advantage of this specific sparseness. After introducing the relevant scaling scenario for brain-scale simulations, we quantitatively discuss the performance on two supercomputers: JUQUEEN and the K computer. The contribution discusses the largest general neuronal network simulation carried out to date, comprising more than a billion neurons, and provides the evidence that neuroscience can exploit petascale machines.

Cortical modelling has many unknowns, but the numbers of neurons and synapses can be accurately estimated. Downscaling, commonly used for feasibility, distorts network dynamics. Fortunately, full-scale modelling is increasingly possible. We develop a full-density multi-area model of macaque vision-related cortex at cellular resolution. A layered microcircuit model with spiking point neurons, customized with area-specific neuron densities, represents each of 32 areas. The inter-area connectivity combines the CoCoMac database, quantitative tracing data, and statistical regularities. The connectivity is refined using mean-field theory. Indegrees increase from V1 to higher areas, which therefore exhibit bursty firing and long intrinsic time scales. Inter-area propagation occurs predominantly in the feedback direction, as in visual imagery. At intermediate inter-area connection strengths, functional connectivity between areas corresponds well with macaque resting-state fMRI. The model achieves consistency of structure and activity at multiple scales and provides a platform for future research.

This talk will introduce the abstractions and simulation techniques for neural tissue simulations capturing the detailed morphology of nerve cells. Models of this type are characterized by low arithmetic intensity and potentially large memory footprints. The simulator of choice for these type of models is NEURON. Here we will present recent achievements in substantially reducing the memory consumption of the simulator as well as the scaling to large scale supercomputers such as the Juelich JuQUEEN or the Argonne MIRA system.

It has been called "the most complete simulation of a piece of excitable brain matter to date", by Christof Koch, President and CSO of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle [1]. After briefly reviewing the HPC-based data integration and reconstruction workflow, I will focus on simulation results obtained using the digital reconstruction of the microcircuitry of somatosensory cortex of P14 rat, running on the "BlueBrain IV" IBM BlueGene/Q system hosted at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS). We validated and explored the spontaneous and sensory evoked dynamics of the microcircuit, and discovered previously unknown biological mechanisms by integrating decades of anatomical and physiological Neuroscience data [2].

From Data to Models: A Semi-Automatic Workflow for Large-Scale Brain Models ; Marc-Oliver Gewaltig (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
We present a semi-automatic process for constructing whole-brain models at the point neuron level from different sets of image stacks. In the first step, we determine the positions of all cells, using high-resolution Nissl stained microscope image. In the second step, we determine the type of each cell (glia, excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons), using in situ hybridization (ISH) image data and compare the resulting cell and neuron numbers to literature data. In the next step, we use two-photon tomography images of rAAV labeled axonal projections to determine the mesoscale connectivity between the neurons in different brain regions. Finally, we obtain a network model that can be simulated with state-of the art simulators like NEST and NEURON.

In Silico Synthesis of Spatially-Embedded Neuronal Morphologies ; Liesbeth Vanherpe (EPFL, Switzerland)
Co-Authors:
Brain functionality depends critically on the connectivity of neurons, which in turn depends on their morphologies. Therefore, to reproduce brain function through simulation of large-scale neuronal networks, it is important to use realistic neuronal morphologies. The classic approach where morphologies are reconstructed from experiments provides invaluable information, but is time consuming and does not scale to the number of cells needed for whole brain simulations. In order to increase the morphological variability available for such simulations, we are developing a framework for synthesizing neurons. We propose to create morphologies based on spatially embedded stochastic models: we combine biological morphometrics obtained from reconstructions with a virtual representation of the brain environment, which confines and guides neurites. We discuss the data structures and algorithms used to provide environmental information to the growing neurons, and demonstrate the current status of the synthesis framework.
Level of Detail in Brain Modeling: Common Abstractions and their Scientific Use
Brain simulation has been a modelling challenge to the same degree as is has been a simulation challenge in the sense that depending on the scope of the question the actual mathematical formalisms vary profoundly. At the same time, the decision for a certain scope and formalism is taken in light of the available data and computational tractability. Traditionally, researchers wanting to understand the function of brains accordingly have chosen a more "top-down" approach, trying to keep complexity to the minimum. Researchers interested in understanding the brain as a system (e.g., needed for diseases) have little choice other than to embrace more "bottom-up" approaches that incorporate the biophysical and even the biochemical diversity found in brain tissue. More recently, the steady increase of computational capabilities as described in Moore's law has reached levels that large scale and fine detail are achievable at the same time. Modern informatics workflows and technologies help us to make complex scientific team efforts more tractable and reproducible. Together with high-quality, brain-wide data sets at increasing resolution and specificity, brain simulation finally is on a journey that should make it possible to overcome the divide. The minisymposium highlights this exciting convergence and the two prominent abstractions to brain modelling and simulation. The first one stops at the resolution of individual nerve cells (point neuron modelling) whereas the second takes the detailed morphologically of neurons and their circuitry into account. We present two major simulation tools, NEST and NEURON, which are open source and community standards for their respective abstraction since many years. Since about a decade these tools are capable of running on massively parallel computers. Recently, they have been shown to be ready to exploit the class of petascale HPC machines. The minisymposium presents the computational characteristics and requirements of the codes. For both abstractions, we showcase specific neuroscience applications using the respective tools and representing cutting edge in silico neuroscientific research. The presenting researchers are members of the European Human Brain Project. The presented simulators are partially supported by that effort in order to integrate them into a novel research infrastructure for brain research. One contributed talk on point neuron modelling and simulation and another on detailed neuron modelling and simulation are presented.

G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) pathways are of high interest since their signal-transduction cascades play an important role in several diseases such as hypertension and obesity. The first proteins that will transfer an extracellular signal received by a GPCR to other regions in the cell are G protein heterotrimers. The specificity by which G protein subunits interact with receptors and effectors defines the variety of responses that a cell is capable of providing due to an extracellular signal. Interestingly, many G proteins have distinct lipidation profiles but little is known how this influences their function. Here, we investigate the effect of myristoylation on the structure and dynamics of Gαi1 and the possible implications for signal transduction. A 2 µs molecular dynamics simulation suggests conformational changes of the switch II and alpha helical domains emphasizing the importance of permanent lipid attachment in tuning the function of signaling proteins.

Computer simulations provide crucial insights and rationales for the design of molecular approaches in (neuro)medicine. I will describe three case studies to illustrate how molecular model building and molecular dynamics simulations of complex molecular assemblies such as membrane proteins help in that process [1-3]. Through selected examples, including key signaling pathways in neurotransmission, the links between a molecular-level understanding of biological mechanisms and original approaches to treat disease conditions will be illuminated. Such treatments may be symptomatic, e.g. by better understanding the function and pharmacology of macromolecular key players, or curative, e.g. through molecular inhibition of disease-inducing molecular processes.

Lipid composition may significantly affect membrane proteins function, yet its impact on the protein structural determinants is not well understood. Here we present a comparative molecular dynamics (MD) study of the human adenosine receptor type 2A (hA2AR) in complex with caffeine "a system of high neuro-pharmacological relevance" within different membrane types: POPC, mixed POPC/POPE and cholesterol-rich membranes. 0.8-μs MD simulations unambiguously show that the helical folding of the amphipathic helix 8 depends on membrane contents. Most importantly, the distinct cholesterol binding into the cleft between helix 1 and 2 stabilizes a specific caffeine-binding pose against others visited during the simulation. Hence, cholesterol presence (approximately 33%-50% in synaptic membrane in central nervous system), often neglected in X-ray determination of membrane proteins, affects the population of the ligand binding poses. We conclude that including a correct description of neuronal membranes may be very important for computer-aided design of ligands targeting hA2AR and possibly other GPCRs.

Co-Authors:
Proteins are molecular machines, whose activity is linked to its ability to suffer conformational transitions as a consequence of external effectors, like changes in the environment, presence of drugs, or other macromolecules. Unfortunately, the representation of protein flexibility is complex as it is too fast for most experimental techniques, and too slow for simulation methods. I will summarize in my talks efforts done at Barcelona to develop a theoretical framework to provide a holistic picture of protein flexibility and dynamics.

Inward-rectifier K+ (Kir) channels are essential to maintain the resting membrane potential of neurons and to buffer extracellular potassium by glial cells. Indeed, Kir malfunction has been suggested to play a role in some neuropathologies, e.g. white matter disease, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Kir activation requires phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), a highly negatively charged lipid located in the inner membrane leaflet. In addition, the presence of other non-specific, anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), is needed for the channel to be responsive at physiological concentrations of PIP2. The dual lipid modulation of Kir channels is not yet fully understood at a molecular level. To give further insight into how the two lipids act cooperatively to open the channel, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that initial binding of PS helps to pre-assemble the binding site of PIP2, which in turn completes Kir activation.
Molecular Neuromedicine: Recent Advances by Computer Simulation and Systems Biology
Innovative neuromedicine approaches require a detailed understanding of the molecular and systems-level causes of neurological diseases, their progression and the response to treatments. Ultimately, neuronal function and diseases are caused by exquisite molecular recognition processes during which specific biomolecules bind to each other allowing neuronal signaling, metabolism, synaptic transmission, etc. The detailed understanding of these processes, as well as the rational design of molecules for technology advances in neuropharmacology, require the characterization of neuronal biomolecules' structure, function, dynamics and energetics. The biomolecules and processes under study are inherently highly complex in terms of their size (typically on the order of 10^5-10^6 atoms) and time-scale (up to seconds), much longer than what can be simulated by standard molecular dynamics approaches (which, nowadays, can typically reach up to microseconds). This requires the development of methodologies in multiscale molecular simulation. Recent advancements include coarse-grained (CG) approaches that allow to study large systems on a long timescale, as well as very accurate hybrid methods combining QM modelling with molecular mechanics (MM) that provide descriptions of key neuronal photoreceptors, such as rhodopsin. In addition, Brownian dynamics are used to study biomolecular recognition and macromolecular assembly processes towards in vivo conditions. Such computational tools are invaluable for description, prediction and understanding of biological mechanisms in a quantitative and integrative way. This workshop will be an ideal forum to discuss both advancements and future directions in multiscale methodologies and applications on key signaling pathways in neurotransmission, such as those based on neuronal G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These novel methodologies might prove to be instrumental to understand the underlying causes of brain diseases and to design new drugs aimed at their treatment.

Simulations of Hydrogen Ingestion Flashes in Giant Stars ; Paul Woodward (University of Minnesota, USA)
Abstract
My team at the University of Minnesota has been collaborating with the team of Falk Herwig at the University of Victoria to simulate brief events in the lives of stars that can greatly affect the heavy elements they synthesize in their interiors and subsequently expel into the interstellar medium. These events are caused by the ingestion of highly combustible hydrogen-rich fuel into the convection zone above a helium burning shell in the deeper interior. Although these events are brief, it can take millions of time steps to simulate the dynamics in sufficient detail to capture subtle aspects of the hydrogen ingestion. To address the computational challenge, we exploit modern multicore and many-core processors and also scale the simulations to run efficiently on over 13,000 nodes of NSF's Blue Waters machine at NCSA. Results of these simulations will be described along with some of the key numerical and computational techniques that make these simulations practical.

IP01 Efforts on Scaling and Optimizing Climate and Weather Forecasting Programs on Sunway TaihuLight
Presenter:
Haohuan Fu (Tsinghua University, China)
+ Abstract
+ Biography
The Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer is the world’s first system with a peak performance greater than 100 PFlops and a parallel scale of over 10 million cores. In contrast to other existing heterogeneous supercomputers, which generally include both CPU processors and PCIe-connected many-core accelerators (NVIDIA GPU or Intel MIC), the computing power of TaihuLight is provided by a homegrown many-core SW26010 CPU that includes both the management processing elements (MPEs) and computing processing elements (CPEs) in one chip. This talk reports efforts on refactoring and optimizing the climate and weather forecasting programs – CAM and WRF – on Sunway TaihuLight. To map the large code base to the millions of cores on the Sunway system, OpenACC-based refactoring was taken as the major approach, with source-to-source translator tools applied to exploit the most suitable parallelism for the CPE cluster and to fit the intermediate variable into the limited on-chip fast buffer. For individual kernels, when comparing the original ported version using only MPEs and the refactored version using both the MPE and CPE clusters, we achieve up to 22x speedup for the compute-intensive kernels. For the 25km resolution CAM global model, the code scales to 24,000 MPEs and 1,536,000 CPEs, achieving a simulation performance of 2.81 model years per day.

IP02 Towards the Decoding of the Human Brain
Presenter:
Katrin Amunts (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany)
+ Abstract
+ Biography
The human brain has a multi-level organisation and high complexity. New approaches are necessary to decode the brain with its 86 billion nerve cells, each with 10,000 connections. 3D Polarized Light Imaging, for example, elucidates the connectional architecture at the level of axons, while keeping the topography of the whole organ; it results in data sets of several petabytes per brain, which should be actively accessible while minimizing their transport. The Human Brain Project creates a cutting-edge HPC- and HPDA infrastructure to address such challenges including cloud-based collaboration and development platforms with databases, workflow systems, petabyte storage, and supercomputers.

Towards the Virtual Rheometer: High Performance Computing for the Red Blood Cell Microstructure
Presenter:
Eva Athena Economides (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Engineering
+ Abstract
+ Paper
Recent advances in medical research and bio-engineering have ledto the development of devices capable of handling fluids and biologicalmatter at the microscale. The operating conditions of medicaldevices are constrained to ensure that characteristic properties ofblood flow, such as mechanical properties and local hemodynamics,are not altered during operation. These properties are a consequenceof the red blood cell (RBC) microstructure, which changesdynamically according to the device geometry. The understandingof the mechanics and dynamics that govern the interactions betweenthe RBCs is crucial for the quantitative characterization ofblood flow, a stepping stone towards the design of medical devicesspecialized to the patient, in the context of personalized medicine.This can be achieved by analyzing the microstructural characteristicsof the RBCs and study their dynamics. In this work we focus onthe quantification of the microstructure of high and low hematocritblood flows, in wall bounded geometries. We present distributionsof the RBCs according to selected deformation criteria and dynamiccharacteristics, and elaborate on mechanisms that control theircollective behavior, focusing on the interplay between cells andshear induced effects.

A Computational Framework to Assess the Influence of Changes in Vascular Geometry on Blood Flow
Presenter:
John Gounley (Duke University, United States of America)
Track(s):
Life Sciences
+ Abstract
+ Paper
Many vascular abnormalities, such as aneurysms or stenoses, developgradually over time. In the early stages of their development,they require monitoring but do not pose sufficient risk to the patientfor a clinician to recommend invasive treatment. With a betterunderstanding of the interplay between hemodynamic factors andchanges in blood vessel geometry, there is an opportunity to improveclinical care by earlier identification of aneurysms or stenoseswith significant potential for further development. Computationalfluid dynamics has shown great promise for investigating this interplayand identifying the associated underlying mechanisms, byusing patient-derived geometries and modifying them to representpotential evolution of the vascular disease. However, a general,extensible framework for comparing simulation results from differentvascular geometries in a direct, quantitative manner does notcurrently exist. As a first step toward the development of such aframework, we present a method for quantifying the relationshipbetween changes in vascular geometry and hemodynamic factors,such as wall shear stress. We apply this framework to study thecorrelation between wall shear stress and geometric changes intwo opposite settings: when flow properties are associated withconsequent changes in the vascular geometry, as in a thoracic aorticaneurysm, and when geometric changes alter the flow, as in aworsening aortic stenosis.

Increasing the Efficiency of Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication with a 2.5D Algorithm and One-Sided MPI
Presenter:
Alfio Lazzaro (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Paper
+ Presentation
Matrix-matrix multiplication is a basic operation in linear algebraand an essential building block for a wide range of algorithms invarious scientific fields. Theory and implementation for the dense,square matrix case are well-developed. If matrices are sparse, withapplication-specific sparsity patterns, the optimal implementationremains an open question. Here, we explore the performance ofcommunication reducing 2.5D algorithms and one-sided MPI communicationin the context of linear scaling electronic structuretheory. In particular, we extend the DBCSR sparse matrix library,which is the basic building block for linear scaling electronic structuretheory and low scaling correlated methods in CP2K. The libraryis specifically designed to efficiently perform block-sparsematrix-matrix multiplication of matrices with a relatively largeoccupation. Here, we compare the performance of the original implementationbased on Cannon's algorithm and MPI point-to-pointcommunication, with an implementation based on MPI one-sidedcommunications (RMA), in both a 2D and a 2.5D approach. The2.5D approach trades memory and auxiliary operations for reducedcommunication, which can lead to a speedup if communication isdominant. The 2.5D algorithm is somewhat easier to implementwith one-sided communications. A detailed description of the implementationis provided, also for non ideal processor topologies,since this is important for actual applications. Given the importanceof the precise sparsity pattern, and even the actual matrix data,which decides the effective fill-in upon multiplication, the tests areperformed within the CP2K package with application benchmarks.Results show a substantial boost in performance for the RMA based2.5D algorithm, up to 1.80x, which is observed to increase with thenumber of processes involved in the parallelization.

Evaluation of a Directive-Based GPU Programming Approach for High-Order Unstructured Mesh Computational Fluid Dynamics
Presenter:
Kunal Puri (Israel Institute of Technology, Israel)
Track(s):
Engineering
+ Abstract
+ Paper
In this work we evaluate the effectiveness of using OpenACCas a paradigm for the auto-parallelization of a high-order unstructuredCFD code on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).This is in lieu of hand-written CUDA or OpenCL code forthe algorithms that have to be separately maintained andtuned to available hardware. Specifically, we compare theperformance of using OpenACC-2.5 for Fortran with thecommercial PGI compiler suite and OpenCL code runningon the Nvidia Kepler series (K20, K40) GPU accelerators.Our results show that the (double precision) GPU acceleratedcode for both approaches is 2 ∼ 3 times faster than the optimizedcounterpart on the CPU (running with an OpenMPmodel). We find that sparse matrix vector multiplicationwith OpenCL is faster than using OpenACC with CuBLAS.While it is in general possible to write an optimized codeusing OpenCL (or CUDA) that outperforms OpenACC, wefind that the directive based approach offered by OpenACCresults in a flexible, unified and hence smaller code-basethat is easier to maintain, is readily portable and promotesalgorithm development.
MS01 Advances in Numerical Wave Propagation for Earthquakes, Cancer, Water Tanks and Oil (1/2) , Room C2-3
Organizer(s):
Tarje Nissen-Meyer (University of Oxford, United Kingdom)
Track(s):
Solid Earth Dynamics
Linear elastodynamics is a physically and mathematically well-understood problem, and numerical techniques have been successfully developed and applied for decades. However, the exuberant scale of the problem reaching 10^12 degrees of freedom, as well as the multi-scale complexity of the underlying parameter space render seismic applications as some of the most challenging HPC problems in the physical sciences. This is particularly the case for the inverse problem in mapping observations to parameters using millions of observations. Technical bottlenecks arise on many ends: meshing complex geological 3D structures, scalability, adaptivity to emerging architectures, data infrastructure for millions of simulations, provenance, code usability. In this minisymposium, we will hear about a diverse range of topics covering state-of-the-art wave propagation at scales between the globe and the human body, each with specifically adaptive techniques and their HPC solutions. Many of the talks will be based on different variants of the spectral-element technique, which has been dominating large-scale seismology for the past two decades. Novel variants include its scalable adaptation to tetrahedra, a new flexible implementation in C++, coupling to pseudo-spectral approaches, and scaling on emerging architectures. Other techniques will be the discontinuous Galerkin method for dynamic earthquake rupture, and an immersive approach to couple numerical modeling with wave tank experiments on FPGAs. Many of the talks will be driven by requirements from specific applications such as nonlinear earthquake rupture dynamics in a complex 3D geological fault system, multiscale geological structures at scales reaching the deep Earth interior, wave tank experiments, seismic tomography at large and industrial scales, and an application to breast cancer detection using ultrasound. In the discussion, we will strive to identify common bottlenecks, ideas to adapt to emerging architectures, any possible basic set of common algorithmic solutions, and discuss where one could move forward to consolidate different approaches based on any commonalities such as meshing, MPI-approaches, data infrastructures, or numerical solvers.

Seismic Wave Propagation on Emerging HPC Architectures
Presenter:
Daniel Peter (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia)
+ Abstract
Regional- and global-scale seismic inversions move towards full-waveform inversions which require accurate simulations of seismic wave propagation in complex 3D media, providing access to the full 3D seismic wavefields. To increase tomographic resolutions, both algorithmic advances as well as new high-performance computing (HPC) hardware should be exploited. Here we will show that for ground motions simulations and seismic tomography the spectral-element packages SPECFEM3D and SPECFEM3D_GLOBE are well suited to follow new HPC trends. These software packages have been extended to make use of general-purpose hardware accelerators such as graphic processing units (GPUs) for both CUDA and OpenCL hardware. Additionally, the code basis has been further optimized for performance on Intel Xeon Phi processors. Applications of forward and adjoint seismic wave propagation on CUDA/OpenCL GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi (KNL) will be shown, comparing performance and benchmark scaling for different simulation setups.
13:30 - 14:00
C++ Template Mixins in Salvus: A Platform for Multiscale Waveform Modeling and Inversion
Presenter:
Michael Afanasiev (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Recent years have been witness to the application of waveform inversion to new and exciting domains, ranging from non-destructive testing to global seismology. Often, each new application brings with it novel wave propagation physics, spatial and temporal discretizations, and models of variable complexity. Adapting existing software to these novel applications often requires a significant investment of time, and acts as a barrier to progress. To combat these problems we have introduced Salvus, a software package designed to solve large-scale full-waveform inverse problems, with a focus on both flexibility and performance. Salvus bridges the gap between research and production codes with a design based on C++ template mixins that separates the physical equations from the numerical core. In this presentation we outline how we have exploited both dynamic and static polymorphism to retain run-time flexibility, while still benefiting from compile-time template resolution.
14:00 - 14:30
Immersive Wave Experimentation: Extreme Low-Latency and HPC Requirements Enabled by FPGA Technology
Presenter:
Dirk-Jan van Manen (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Immersive experimentation is a new paradigm for wave-based laboratory experimentation aimed at overcoming lab-size and corresponding frequency-range related limitations that plague conventional wave propagation experimentation. Using so-called exact boundary conditions, a physical experimentation domain can be immersed in an arbitrarily large numerical domain in such a way that the waves in the physical domain drive the “simulation” in the numerical domain and vice-versa, in real-time. Waves propagating towards the walls of the experimentation domain are sensed by dense receiver arrays and extrapolated to the boundary ahead of time where they are actively cancelled using dense source arrays. Outgoing waves are also extrapolated through the numerical domain using pre-computed Green’s functions and re-emitted into the experimentation domain, enabling multiple scattering interactions between the laboratory and numerical domain. We present the system enabling the implementation of this unique laboratory at ETH, with a focus on the extreme low-latency and HPC requirements.

Petascale Computation of Multi-Physics Seismic Simulations - and Beyond
Presenter:
Alice-Agnes Gabriel (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany)
+ Abstract
Capturing the observed complexity of earthquake sources in concurrence with seismic wave propagation simulations is an inherently multi-scale, multi-physics problem. Here I present earthquake scenarios resolving high-detail dynamic rupture evolution and high frequency ground motion. The up to multi-PetaFLOP simulations are performed with SeisSol (www.seissol.org), an open-source software package based on an ADER-Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme solving the seismic wave equations in elastic, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic media with high-order accuracy in time and space on tetrahedral unstructured meshes. SeisSol has been optimized on all software levels obtaining up to 44% peak performance on full-machine production runs on some of the largest supercomputers worldwide. It features MPI+OpenMP parallelization overlapping communication and computation, cluster-based local time stepping and asynchronous parallel input/output schemes. I conclude with an outlook on ExaHyPE (www.exahype.eu) a flexible engine to solve hyperbolic systems of Partial Differential Equations via explicit ADER-DG or Finite Volume schemes on future exascale hardware.

In this series of two minisymposia, a special focus lies on providing a platform for exchanging ideas about scalable, memory-efficient, fast and resilient solving techniques. These characteristics are crucial for science and engineering-driven applications making use of exascale computing like geophysics, astrophysics, aerodynamics, etc. Algorithms in high-performance computing require a rethinking of the standard approaches to ensure on the one hand the full usage of the future computing power, and on the other hand energy-efficiency. A careful implementation of all performance-relevant parts and an intelligent combination with external libraries is fundamental for exascale computation. Multigrid and domain decomposition play an important role in many scientific applications and have often developed ideas separately using the immense compute power of supercomputers. The minisymposia address both communities and focus on exchanging current research progress related to exascale enabled solving techniques.

Parallel Nonlinear Domain Decomposition in Multiscale Problems
Presenter:
Oliver Rheinbach (TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany)
+ Abstract
For a few decades, Newton-Krylov algorithms with suitable preconditioners such as domain decomposition (DD) or multigrid (MG) methods (Newton-Krylov-DD or Newton-Krylov-MG) have been the workhorse for the parallel solution of nonlinear implicit problems. In these methods, the problem is first linearized and then decomposed into parallel problems on subdomains. In nonlinear domain decomposition methods, however, the nonlinear problem is decomposed before Newton linearization, which increases the concurrency of the algorithm. We discuss recent nonlinear domain decomposition of the FETI-DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting) or BDDC (Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints) type to solve nonlinear hyperelasticity or plasticity problems and combine them with efficient AMG (Algebraic Multigrid) methods. We then apply these methods within a highly parallel two-scale numerical homogenization scheme using millions of MPI ranks for the simulation of micro-heterogeneous materials.

FETI Based Solvers for Exascale Computations in Mechanics
Presenter:
Tomáš Kozubek (TU Ostrava, Czech Republic)
+ Abstract
This contribution presents the Hybrid Total FETI (HTFETI) domain decomposition method implemented in the in-house library ESPRESO (http://espreso.it4i.cz). ESPRESO is designed to run on massively parallel machines with hundreds of thousands of CPU cores and can exploit modern many-core accelerators. HTFETI is a multilevel FETI method and is scalable for cases where classical FETI method fails due to the large number of subdomains and resulting large coarse problem. The penalty is that the resulting linear system requires more iterations for the same domain decomposition when compared to the FETI method. This negative effect can be partially reduced using transformation of the basis realized by additional Lagrange multipliers. This is an alternative to the approach which modifies the subdomain stiffness matrices which can generate higher filling of the Cholesky factors and increases both the memory requirements and the processing time.

Recent Advances in Multilevel Domain Decomposition: Large Scales, Heterogeneous Problems, and Unfitted Finite Elements
Presenter:
Santiago Badia (Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Spain)
+ Abstract
In this work, we present an object-oriented (OO) software framework for the development of highly-scalable multilevel domain decomposition methods. Our motivation here is not only to show the excellent scalability results of the preconditioners resulting from the framework, but also to present its customization to challenging applications. In particular, we will show that slightly simple modifications of the algorithm, with a coarse space definition based on the physical coefficients in the underlying PDE, leads to robust methods for heterogeneous problems for some PDE problems. On the other hand, we consider the application of these preconditioners to unfitted methods, which can destroy the condition number of the linear systems to be solved, depending on the location of the cell cuts. We show how to make these preconditioners robust also for embedded boundary methods for coercive PDEs by a proper modification of the inter-subdomain constraints.

GPU-Accelerated Matrix-Free Methods in Geophysics: Case Studies in pTatin3d and StagYY
Presenter:
Karl Rupp (TU Wien, Austria)
+ Abstract
We present recent results in using graphics processing units (GPUs) for computational hotspots in multigrid methods in the geophysics packages pTatin3d and StagYY. A common approach is to express smoothing, grid transfer and residual evaluations as sparse matrix-vector products.However, sparse matrix-vector products offer only low arithmetic intensity. As a remedy, we employ matrix-free methods, which allow for increased arithmetic intensity and thus performance, particularly for higher-order discretization methods. We present results obtained for a Q2-P1 discretization used in the simulation of lithospheric dynamics, and for a first-order staggered grid approach for simulating mantle convection. Through a careful choice of per-thread register usage, thread assignments, and tricks like warp shuffles, our performance results match those predicted by our performance models. Since the techniques presented in this talk are not restricted to applications in geophysics, our results and techniques should be of interest to a broad audience.

The language of linear algebra is ubiquitous across scientific and engineering disciplines and is used to describe phenomena and algorithms alike. The translation of linear algebra expressions to high-performance code is a surprisingly challenging problem, requiring knowledge in high-performance computing, compilers, and numerical linear algebra. Typically, the user is offered two contrasting alternatives: either high-level languages (e.g. Matlab), which enable fast prototyping at the expense of performance, or low-level languages (C and Fortran), which allow for highly efficient solutions at the expense of extremely long development cycles. This workshop brings together domain specialists who believe that productivity and high-performance need not be mutually exclusive.

LAMP: The Linear Algebra Mapping Problem
Presenter:
Paolo Bientinesi (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
+ Abstract
Matrix expressions appear in just about every computational discipline; their fast and accurate evaluation is a time-consuming task that requires expertise in both numerical linear algebra and high-performance computing. On one hand, the numerical linear algebra community made tremendous progress in the identification, layering, and optimization of computational kernels. On the other hand, the translation of a target expression into a sequence of kernels - the task we named "Linear Algebra Mapping Problem" (LAMP) - remains a duty for domain experts. Indeed, while compilers excel at producing fast code for scalar expressions, they are still in their infancy when it comes to dealing with matrices. Nowadays, many tools and languages (Matlab, Julia, Armadillo, Eigen, ...) provide solutions to LAMP, but, as we point out, there is a lot of room for improvement. We give a formal description of LAMP, and discuss the design and the results of a prototype compiler.

Hydra: From Linear Equation to Parallel Heterogeneous Code
Presenter:
Denis Barthou (INRIA, France)
+ Abstract
Hydra is a high level language and its compiler for linear equations. It accepts an equation written in terms of operations on matrices and automatically produces highly efficient code to solve these equations. By tiling the matrices, the equations are transformed into either a single new equation containing terms involving tiles, or into multiple equations, some of which can be solved in parallel with each other. Hydra continues transforming the equations using tiling and seeking terms that Hydra knows how to compute or equations it knows how to solve. The end result is that by transforming the equations Hydra produces a parallel task graph that is then scheduled by a runtime, StarPU. In this way, Hydra enables the automatic production of efficient solvers requiring very little or no coding at all and delivering performance approximating that of the highly tuned library routines.

Armadillo: C++ Template Metaprogramming for Compile-Time Optimization of Linear Algebra
Presenter:
Ryan Curtin (Symantec Corporation, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Armadillo is a C++ library for linear algebra (matrix maths), enabling mathematical operations to be written in a manner similar to the widely used Matlab language, while at the same time providing efficient computation. It is used for relatively quick conversion of research code into production environments, and as a base for software such as MLPACK (a machine learning library). Through judicious use of template metaprogramming and operator overloading, linear algebra operations are automatically expressed as types, enabling compile-time parsing and evaluation of compound mathematical expressions. This in turn allows the compiler to produce specialized and optimized code. In this talk we cover the fundamentals of template metaprogramming that make compile-time optimizations possible, and demonstrate the internal workings of the Armadillo library. We show that the code automatically generated via Armadillo is comparable with custom C implementations. Armadillo is open source software, available at http://arma.sourceforge.net

Design Choices for Numerical Linear Algebra in a Compiled High-Level Language
Presenter:
Jiahao Chen (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States of America)
+ Abstract
The Julia language is designed for technical computing and ships with a large linear algebra library. One of Julia’s significant language features is an extensive type system which has shaped the development of the linear algebra library. As developers have grown familiar with the type system, they have aimed to map linear algebra structure to types. A different aspect of the type system has allowed many linear algebra routines to work for arbitrary data types which, among other things, has facilitated the development of automatic differentiation tools. Based on examples from the development of Julia, I’ll discuss the relation between the type system and design decisions including some of the mistakes along the way. I’ll conclude with a discussion of integrating new functionality for GPUs and distributed computing into Julia’s existing linear algebra design.

Chemistry & Materials, Physics
At the beginning of the current century we are facing massive challenges due to the increasing global demand for energy, focused on two major issues. On one hand, conventional fossil fuel resources such as oil, natural gas, and coal are limited and dwindling. On the other hand, the emissions due to combustion of fossil fuels evidently impact the chemical composition of our atmosphere, leading to adverse effects on the climate and environment. These inevitable global challenges imminently demand for technological advances in energy conversion, storage and transport. The search for novel materials for energy applications has recently become an extremely active area of research worldwide to address these issues, with efforts in chemistry, solid-state physics, and materials science, via the Materials Genome Initiative in the US and related initiatives in other countries. In this search, computational tools are being actively developed not only to explore uncharted chemical space of new materials, but also to understand the complex interplay of materials properties with the underlying crystal structures. One particular class of materials for energy applications are thermoelectric materials, which are required to drive thermoelectric generators that allow for a reliable, clean, emission-free conversion of (waste) heat into electricity. Until the mid-1990s, thermoelectrics had been considered inefficient and not economically relevant, but with enhanced structural engineering and intense research on novel complex materials the interest for thermoelectric materials has been recently revived. The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is governed by the so-called figure of merit zT, which is maximized by increasing the thermopower and electrical conductivity while reducing the thermal conductivity. These materials properties are however strongly interrelated, e.g. in most materials the thermal and electrical conductivities correlate with each other through the Wiedemann-Franz-law. Hence, the search for a material with a maximal zT poses a non-trivial materials design challenge. This symposium aims at bringing together scientists to share their computational efforts in thermoelectric materials development. An accurate description of the bulk lattice thermal transport, which is governed by phonon-phonon interactions, demands advanced simulation techniques and large HPC infrastructures. Solving the Boltzmann phonon transport equation requires the knowledge of the anharmonic energy contributions which give rise to phonon scattering, posing one of the computationally most demanding aspects in modeling thermal resistivity. Density functional perturbation theory and finite difference methods are currently state-of-the-art approaches, but remain computationally highly demanding. Furthermore, the interactions of phonons with electrons become increasingly important at elevated temperatures and have recently been the focus of research in thermoelectric materials. Finally, methods for modeling of transport properties on a large scale are required for the discovery of new materials with improved thermoelectric properties. The focus of this symposium will be on novel approaches, amongst others based on methods from machine learning, signal processing, and high-throughput techniques, in modeling transport properties to advance in silico discovery of thermoelectric materials.

First-Principles Studies of Strongly Anharmonic Crystalline Solids
Presenter:
Vidvuds Ozolins (Yale University, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Strongly anharmonic solids, which can be loosely defined as those where the first-order perturbation theory is insufficient, constitute a broad class of technological materials with interesting properties (ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, metallic alloys). First-principles approached based on the density-functional theory (DFT) have been particularly difficult to develop due to high computational cost of direct simulations and/or technical difficulties involved in parameterizing interatomic interactions. We present a systematic approach to constructing lattice dynamics Hamiltonians based on compressive sensing, which allows to extend the reach of DFT to nanosecond time scales, enabling direct simulation of thermodynamic and thermal transport properties. Examples from the field of thermoelectric materials will be presented to illustrate the advantages of our approach and discuss interesting phenomena arising from the nonlinearity of the interatomic forces.

We present here a general approach to calculating thermal transport based on density-functional perturbation theory, where harmonic and anharmonic terms are calculated from first-principles and used in the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation. We present results for bulk silicon and germanium, their alloys and superlattices, single-sheet graphene, highlighting the effects of dimensionality, alloying, or nanostructuring in engineering thermal conductance and the figure of merit of thermoelectric devices. Last, we show how the study of the exact solutions of the linearised Boltzmann transport equation forces revisiting some classic concepts of heat propagation, and where phonons cannot be considered the elementary carriers of heat.

Ab Initio Calculations of the Lattice Thermal Conductivity and the Discovery of New Thermoelectric Materials
Presenter:
Laurent Chaput (University of Lorraine, France)
+ Abstract
Within the last few years it has been possible to compute the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk materials using ab initio methods. The interactions between the phonons are obtained from density functional theory and this information is incorporated into the Boltzmann to obtain the thermal conductivity. The high accuracy obtained from those calculations suggests they could be useful for finding new materials. We present several strategies that we used performing such a search. The first method we used is datamining. We screened the entire Material Project library to find materials with ultra low thermal conductivity. The second method is based on polymorphism and was used to study Zn-Sb compounds. Finally, we conclude showing how ab initio calculations can be combined with Monte Carlo simulations to describe thermal conduction at the micron scale.

Systematic Data Collection from First-Principles Lattice Thermal Conductivity Calculation and its Analysis
Presenter:
Atsushi Togo (Kyoto University, Japan)
+ Abstract
Recent progress of computers enables us to calculate lattice thermal conductivity from first-principles. We can obtain highly reliable results based on Boltzmann equation with the collision term obtained from first-principles anharmonic phonon calculation. Although currently this calculation requires a lot of computational demand, its computation can be easily distributed among very many computer-nodes with no overhead and each piece is computationally not demanding at all. Using this calculation approach, we can systematically compute lattice thermal conductivities of a variety of compounds and collect a huge amount of fruitful microscopic information on lattice thermal conductivity such as phonon lifetime and group velocity. Our current objective is to develop ways to analyze these detailed data. We have been applying machine learning approaches for it and visualization will play an important role. We introduce a phonon open database (http://phonondb.mtl.kyoto-u.ac.jp), that we are making and hosting.
MS05 Higher Order Discretizations in Large Eddy Simulation of High Reynolds Number Turbulent Flow in Engineering Applications , Room E
Organizer(s):
Ramesh Balakrishnan (Argonne National Laboratory, United States of America)
Track(s):
Engineering
The simulation of turbulent flows in engineering applications is often characterized by high Reynolds number, physical processes that depend on length scales that are too small to be resolved, and complex geometry. The advances in computing hardware notwithstanding, it is becoming clear that large eddy simulation (LES) of such flows, where the resolved/filtered scales of motion are evolved, and the unresolved scaled are modeled, is still intractable. The large number of grid points required for a well-resolved simulation of the flow physics places a greater need for modeling the unresolved scales and evolving the resolved scales in a manner whereby the dissipative and dispersive errors are minimized. Given that in a LES, the errors in the solution are a combination of filtering errors that are characterized by the filter width (delta), the numerical order of accuracy, which is characterized by the cell width (h), and the sub-grid scale (SGS) modeling error, an assessment of the resulting “solution” is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to isolate the effects of each of these contributing factors. This area of research offers opportunities to quantify the tradeoffs between the computational advantages offered by higher-order numerical methods and the turbulence resolving capabilities of these numerical methods in the context of LES of high Reynolds number flows. On emerging exascale computing platforms, where the available power is capped at 20MW, the architecture is beginning to be characterized by processors with a large number of cores that run at dynamic clock speeds that decrease as the cores begin to overheat, deep memory hierarchies with less on-chip memory, and multiple pathways to parallelizing algorithms, ranging from coarse-grained parallelism (MPI) to fine-grained parallelism (threads, vectorization). The reduced on-chip memory requires time consuming operations to fetch data from external (off-chip) memory to local cache in order to make computations possible! On such platforms, the traditional measure of assessing the efficiency of parallel codes, via FLOPs alone, is being replaced by the more meaningful arithmetic intensity (AI), which is defined as the ratio of FLOPs to the number of load-store operations. For turbulence simulations, it would appear that higher-order numerical methods that are less memory bandwidth limited may offer an obvious advantage. However, despite a veritable body of literature that documents the advantages of higher-order methods when applied to problems that are ideal – in the sense that the cases to which they have been applied are those where one has a fairly high degree of control on the inflow and boundary conditions, and the geometry of the computational domain – it is not quite clear if these methods could serve as the gold standard when one applies higher-order methods to drive the compute engine in a predictive flow simulation tool, with considerable uncertainties in the flow conditions and complexities in the geometry. The focus of this minisymposium, therefore, is a presentation of higher-order numerical discretizations, their impacts on the resolvable turbulent flow physics, and the scaling and parallel performance of higher-order discretizations on emerging computing hardware.

Numerical Simulations and Robust Predictions of Cloud Cavitation Collapse
Presenter:
Fabian Wermelinger (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
We will present large-scale simulations of free-field cloud collapses with up to O(10k) resolved gas bubbles. This large number of resolved bubbles is necessary in order to collect meaningful statistics. We will provide detailed insight into the collapse process that starts from the outer surface of the cloud and propagates inwards in the form of a pressure, velocity, and bubble deformation wave. Furthermore, we will address comparisons to simplified models, in particular, Rayleigh-Plesset-like equations. Additionally, we will also quantify uncertainties in peak pressures and micro-jet formation of clouds under random initial bubble locations and radii. These degrees of randomness manifest themselves in a wide range of peak pressures. We will show uncertainty quantifications on the aforementioned quantities of interest using the non-intrusive Multi-Level Monte Carlo method coupled with our multicomponent flow solver.

Scalable Implicit Flow Solver for Realistic Wing Simulations with Flow Control
Presenter:
Michel Rasquin (Cenaero, Belgium)
+ Abstract
The open source code PHASTA is a parallel, hierarchic (2nd to 5th order accurate), adaptive, stabilized (finite-element) transient analysis tool for the solution of compressible or incompressible flows. This code was extended under an ALCF Early Science project to scale well to over 3M IBM BG/Q processes using a 92 billion element fully unstructured, adapted mesh. This talk will chronicle some of the lessons learned in that effort and discuss new challenges that are being faced in similar ALCF Early Science projects to extend this code to the next ALCF machines (Theta, already in service, and Aurora, the exascale pathway machine that will follow it). Both machines are based on Intel Xeon Phi processors. While prevailing wisdom suggests that algorithms will have to radically change between BG/Q and Phi, early simulations with PHASTA on Phi suggest that flexible versions of existing algorithms still scale surprisingly well.

Developing Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Large Eddy Simulation of Multistage Turbomachinery
Presenter:
Michel Rasquin (Cenaero, Belgium)
+ Abstract
The discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) combines very high accuracy on low-quality unstructured meshes with excellent computational performance. It furthermore offers a flexible framework for adaptivity, and maintains full accuracy near boundaries and sliding interfaces. The precision, geometric flexibility, and efficiency make DGM a prime candidate for enabling the reliable and accurate use of adaptive Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for industrial design. This talk will discuss the essential steps and perspectives in the development of a new DGM solver named Argo and developed at Cenaero for Large Eddy Simulations of multistage turbomachinery flows. This talk will focus in particular on the most recent efforts geared towards (i) the assessment of the Argo solver for transonic flow and (ii) the accurate efficient implementation and scalability of rotor-stator sliding interfaces for large-scale computations on the BG/Q system at the Argonne National Leadership Facility.

Scale-Resolving Simulations with SU2 for Wind Engineering Applications
Presenter:
Ramesh Balakrishnan (Argonne National Laboratory, United States of America)
+ Abstract
The open source suite of C++ codes, SU2, for aerodynamic design consists of an unstructured mesh finite volume (FV) solver and a Discontinuous Galerkin finite element (DG_FE) higher-order solver for compressible flows. The code is designed to exploit the SIMD parallelism on large vector registers, thread level parallelism that is available on the large number of cores per compute node and the hardware threads per core, in addition to MPI, which facilitates the data movement between compute nodes. The SU2 flow solver has been applied to large eddy simulations for problems in wind engineering involving flow over airfoils and the atmospheric boundary layer over canonical terrain geometries. This talk presents the scaling and performance of SU2 on the IBM BG/Q and Intel Xeon Phi platforms, and the results of the LES that have been carried out with the FV and DG solvers.

The recent observation of different tiers of TOP 500 show a growing impact of computing systems based on architectural features such as: more complex memory hierarchies incorporating fast yet limited memory per core, addition of large capacity non-volatile memory, substantial increase in cores per shared-memory "island", and the closer and closer integration of high-performance interconnects with the CPU and memory subsystem. Application codes that want to take advantage of such systems need to reshape to achieve good levels of performance. At the same time, it is important to ensure that codes can be maintained and developed further without undue complexity imposed by the execution systems. Moreover, significant advances in the field of reconfigurable computing and their system integration have generated major interest: new generations provide highly efficient FP units, and fast cache-coherent interconnects to CPUs were announced. On the SW side, the momentum around OpenCL is lowering the entry barriers. Tighter Integration of FPGAs and CPUs will allow traditional FPGA workloads to get closer to the more "general purpose" server and require less specialized custom boards. These emerging computing architectures generate innovative developments in computer science and applied mathematics, which in return, enable new capacities for scientific applications. The minisymposium will be an excellent opportunity to share some of the most recent, leading edge advances for scientific applications enabled by these trends. New algorithmic developments, and how to code them on the emerging architectures will be at the heart of the session: new PDE solvers for QCD, efficient implementation of Fast Multiple Methods applied to biomolecular simulations, how to use the cache-aware-roofline model to guide the performance optimization, and high energy physics workloads projecting efficient usage of nodes combining Xeon and FPGA.

The Fast Multipole Method and Point Dipole Moment Polarizable Force Fields
Presenter:
Jonathan Coles (TU Munich, Germany)
+ Abstract
Today, most biophysical simulations use complex, fixed-charge force field models to capture the atomic interactions in proteins and other organic molecules in addition to the surrounding water solution. Polarizable models, which can account dynamically for the changing electrostatic environment often found in proteins and DNA, are increasingly being recognized as the path forward to more accurate and predictive simulations. The cost has been a significant decrease in performance on the order of 10x, as one often has to iteratively solve for self-consistent dipole configurations. In this talk, I will present a sophisticated, polarizable force field model that has been combined with a highly parallel implementation of the Fast Multipole Method. Together, the cost overhead of using a polarizable force field has been significantly reduced, allowing simulations of large molecules to be achieved.

Grid: A Data Parallel Structured Cartesian Framework for Lattice QCD Calculations
Presenter:
Peter Boyle (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom)
+ Abstract
We discuss the motivation, implementation details, and performance of a new physics code base called Grid. It is intended to be more performant, more general, but similar in spirit to QDP++. Our approach is to engineer the basic type system to be consistently fast, rather than bolt on a few optimised routines, and we attempt to write all our optimised routines directly in the Grid framework. It is hoped this will deliver best known practice performance across the next generation of supercomputers, which will provide programming challenges to traditional scalar codes. We illustrate the programming patterns used to implement our goals, and advances in productivity that have been enabled by using new features in C++11.Initial results are presented on Broadwell and Knight's Landing with both Intel Omnipath and Cray Aries interconnects. Techniques for maximising delivered communication bandwidth in the Halo Exchange by using MPI3 features are discussed.

Modernizing Code for the Intel "Knights Landing" Processor: Real World Tales from the IXPUG Trenches

Michael Lysaght (Intel Inc., Ireland)
+ Abstract
Successful exploitation of new computing devices with high parallelism comes with an increased need to expose more task, data and pipeline parallelism at the algorithmic level, as well as the need to significantly reduce data movement by making more effective use of cache. With these challenges in mind, there is a renewed demand for advances in performance analysis tools to provide a clearer view on where performance bottlenecks lie. An overview will be provided of how one such technique, the cache-aware roofline model (CARM), can facilitate deeper insight into performance challenges on the Knights Landing processor. We propose a deep dive on how the CARM has guided optimizations on Reverse Time Migration (RTM) kernels at ICHEC, as well as a wider perspective on how tools-aided approaches to the roofline methodology are being employed by several members of the Intel Xeon Phi User Group (IXPUG) on real-world applications.

FPGA Acceleration for High-Throughput Data Processing in High-Energy Physics Experiments

+ Abstract
The LHCb experiment at CERN will upgrade its detector by 2018/2019 to a 'triggerless' readout scheme, where all the readout electronics - able to read out the detector at 40MHz - and several sub-detector parts will be replaced. This increases the data bandwidth from the detector down to the event filter farm to 40TBit/s. The architecture of such a computing farm is a challenging task and several compute accelerator technologies are being considered for use inside the new event filter farm. In designing the architecture of such a computing farm, the usage of the Intel platform hosting a general Xeon CPU and a high performance Arria 10 FPGA inside a multi-chip package linked via a high speed and low latency link is being tested. A computing intensive algorithm was successfully ported to the Intel(r) Xeon(r)/FPGA platform and accelerated; Verilog and OpenCL kernels are compared in performance and development time.

Emerging Domains in HPC, Life Sciences
The applied life sciences are of huge importance, both economically (the pharmaceutical sector alone supplies something like 30% of the exports of Switzerland), and in terms of tackling societal challenges such as aging populations, the increasing burden of chronic diseases, and spiraling costs of health care. The challenges in the industry are many and varied, and include the need for a much better understanding of why certain promising drugs fail trials, how best to identify and model sub-groups in patient populations to deliver on the promises of precision medicine, and how to integrate information and models ranging from the molecular level up to patient-worn sensors. Due to their importance, the applied life sciences should be supported with the best possible tools to tackle these challenges. Whilst the use of computing is reasonably well established in this sector, the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) is much less well established when compared to other sectors such as engineering or physics. This is indeed unfortunate given the potential of in silico experiments and analysis of complex data to advance the state of the art in the field and deliver concrete benefits to society. In this minisymposium we will explore various approaches to the use of computing for the applied life sciences, ranging from lower-level systems modeling, through the application of large-scale machine learning to high volume screens in drug discovery, to analysis of genomic information. Each of these has different modeling and scaling challenges and has had varying levels of success in the application of HPC to the problem. We will have speakers from industry, academia and industrial-academic collaborations alike, giving varying perspectives on the state of the art and the potential for the application of HPC. The specific areas covered by the speakers will be the following: - HPC implementation of multi-target compound activity prediction in chemogenomics based on state of the art large scale machine learning techniques - Challenges in data handling and computation for the analysis of DNA for personalized healthcare - Systems biology and HPC

Federated Analysis of Genomes for Personalized Healthcare
Presenter:
Satu Nahkuri (Roche, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
In precision medicine, healthcare is tailored for individuals with unique profiles rather than imposed on them based on average responses of large patient cohorts. To develop and choose the right treatments for the right patients, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments are being performed on the genomes, transcriptomes and epigenomes of hundreds of thousands of individuals. However, the prohibitively large size and worldwide dispersion of NGS data often prevent researchers from performing aggregated analyses and can undermine the reproducibility of results. To solve these challenges, Roche is integrating NGS data sets by developing a modular and lean platform that leverages open standards, virtualizes file systems and processing pipelines, and supports data provenance. This model also lends itself to storage and analysis of medical images. Our system will link HPC platforms on two continents, enable reuse of precious data sets for exploratory research, and foster collaboration within a large in-house scientific community.

HPC for Inferring Causal Biological Networks
Presenter:
Joerg Stelling (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Inference of mechanistic, causal models for biological systems is challenging both theoretically and computationally because limited knowledge and data often require one to address structural (regarding the governing dynamic equations) and parametric uncertainties simultaneously. The talk discusses these challenges for dynamical systems (models) and associated opportunities for HPC. Specific approaches to be addressed are: (i) numerical methods to characterize uncertainties in high-dimensional parameter spaces based on polynomial approximations; (ii) Bayesian inference of model structures that relies on projections in parameter space instead of a (combinatorially complex) enumeration of all possible models; and (iii) coarse-graining of this approach when only patterns of interactions in a network are of primary interest. Molecular-level examples will link to potential applications in precision medicine.

Practical Experience with Software for Next-Generation Sequence Analyses in HPC Environment

+ Abstract
Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies significantly changed our understanding of genomic content of living organisms and their evolution. The talk will give a brief overview of current state-of-the-art software tools used for raw DNA sequence processing, genome assembly, single-nucleotide polymorphism detection, filtering and further analyses. The software tools are usually memory-bound and have highly variable resource requirements, are often written in higher-level languages while much less in C or C++. Only a handful use MPI or threads at the best. The talk will show several examples of CPU- or memory-hungry applications. The last part of the talk will give a brief description about the technology for remote execution of the before mentioned bioinformatics tools on a supercomputer infrastructure directly from the user interface of the client application without the necessity to connect directly to the HPC cluster and manage the jobs from the command line interface.

+ Abstract
+ Paper
As processor clock rates become more dynamic and workloadsbecome more adaptive, the vulnerability to global synchronizationthat already complicates programming for performance in today'spetascale environment will be exacerbated. Algebraic multigrid(AMG), the solver of choice in many large-scale PDE-based simulations,scales well in the weak sense, with fixed problem size pernode, on tightly coupled systems when loads are well balanced andcore performance is reliable. However, its strong scaling to manycores within a node is challenging. Reducing synchronization andincreasing concurrency are vital adaptations of AMG to hybrid architectures.Recent communication-reducing improvements to classicaladditive AMG by Vassilevski and Yang improve concurrencyand increase communication-computation overlap, while retainingconvergence properties close to those of standard multiplicativeAMG, but remain bulk synchronous. We extend the Vassilevski andYang additive AMG to asynchronous task-based parallelism usinga hybrid MPI+OmpSs (from the Barcelona Supercomputer Center)within a node, along with MPI for internode communications.We implement a tiling approach to decompose the grid hierarchyinto parallel units within task containers. We compare against theMPI-only BoomerAMG and the Auxiliary-space Maxwell Solver(AMS) in the hypre library for the 3D Laplacian operator and theelectromagnetic diffusion, respectively. In time to solution for a fullsolve an MPI-OmpSs hybrid improves over an all-MPI approachin strong scaling at full core count (32 threads per single Haswellnode of the Cray XC40) and maintains this per node advantage asboth weak scale to thousands of cores, with MPI between nodes.

+ Abstract
+ Paper
An increasing number of scientific domains are confronted withthe arduous task of managing large scale applications. For suchapplications, gradient estimations come at a large computationalcost. Despite notable advances in automatic differentiation duringthe last years, its use in this context may reveal too costly in memory,inadequate for parallel architecture or require expert knowledge.For these reasons, we investigate an alternative approach that usesthe finite difference method to evaluate the gradient of functionsmodeled as a directed acyclic graph. This approach enables thereuse of partial results from previous partial derivatives evaluationsand thus reduces the computational cost.We identify a discrete optimization problem arising in the limited-memorycontext of large scale applications that aims to maximizethe computational efficiency of the gradient approximation byscheduling the partial derivatives. This optimization problem is extendedto consider the partitioning of the computations on multipleprocessors. We further derive some properties of these optimizationproblems, such as their upper bound on performance gains.Following a brief description of algorithms designed to obtainsensible solutions for both problems, we study the increase in performanceresulting from sequential and parallel schedules obtainedfor synthetic DAGs. Finally, we employ this approach to acceleratethe gradient evaluation of DAGs representing real evolutionarybiology models. For one of these large scale applications, our approachis shown to be nearly 400 times faster than a state-of-the-artsoftware in sequential, and more than 11,000 times faster whenusing 256 processors.

+ Abstract
+ Paper
A fundamental understanding of how various biological traits andfeatures provide organisms with a competitive advantage can helpus improve the design of a number of mechanical systems. Numericaloptimization can play an invaluable role for this purpose, byallowing us to scrutinize the evolution of specific biological adaptationsin nature. Importantly, the use of numerical optimization canhelp us overcome limiting constraints that restrict the evolutionarycapability of biological species. We capitalize on these advantagesby coupling high-fidelity simulations of self-propelled swimmerswith evolutionary optimization algorithms, to examine peculiarswimming patterns observed in a number of fish species. Morespecifically, we investigate the intermittent form of locomotionreferred to as 'burst-and-coast' swimming, which involves a fewquick flicks of the fish's tail followed by a prolonged unpoweredglide. This mode of swimming is believed to confer energetic benefits,in addition to several other advantages. We discover a range ofintermittent-swimming patterns, the most efficient of which resemblesthe swimming behaviour observed in live fish. We also discoverpatterns which lead to a marked increase in swimming-speed, albeitwith a significant increase in energy expenditure. Notably, the useof multi-objective optimization reveals locomotion patterns thatstrike the perfect balance between speed and efficiency, which canbe invaluable for use in robotic applications. As an additional goalof the paper, we highlight the ease with which disparate codes canbe coupled via the software framework used, without encumberingthe user with the details of efficient parallelization and machine-learningbased task-scheduling.

Solid Earth Dynamics
Linear elastodynamics is a physically and mathematically well-understood problem, and numerical techniques have been successfully developed and applied for decades. However, the exuberant scale of the problem reaching 10^12 degrees of freedom, as well as the multi-scale complexity of the underlying parameter space render seismic applications as some of the most challenging HPC problems in the physical sciences. This is particularly the case for the inverse problem in mapping observations to parameters using millions of observations. Technical bottlenecks arise on many ends: meshing complex geological 3D structures, scalability, adaptivity to emerging architectures, data infrastructure for millions of simulations, provenance, code usability. In this minisymposium, we will hear about a diverse range of topics covering state-of-the-art wave propagation at scales between the globe and the human body, each with specifically adaptive techniques and their HPC solutions. Many of the talks will be based on different variants of the spectral-element technique, which has been dominating large-scale seismology for the past two decades. Novel variants include its scalable adaptation to tetrahedra, a new flexible implementation in C++, coupling to pseudo-spectral approaches, and scaling on emerging architectures. Other techniques will be the discontinuous Galerkin method for dynamic earthquake rupture, and an immersive approach to couple numerical modeling with wave tank experiments on FPGAs. Many of the talks will be driven by requirements from specific applications such as nonlinear earthquake rupture dynamics in a complex 3D geological fault system, multiscale geological structures at scales reaching the deep Earth interior, wave tank experiments, seismic tomography at large and industrial scales, and an application to breast cancer detection using ultrasound. In the discussion, we will strive to identify common bottlenecks, ideas to adapt to emerging architectures, any possible basic set of common algorithmic solutions, and discuss where one could move forward to consolidate different approaches based on any commonalities such as meshing, MPI-approaches, data infrastructures, or numerical solvers.

Waveform Tomography for Breast Cancer Detection with Ultrasound
Presenter:
Christian Boehm (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Ultrasound waveform tomography is a promising method for imaging and characterizing breast tissue, but it remains computationally challenging especially when considering 3D scanning systems and high frequencies. Despite the vastly different scale, ultrasound tomography shares a remarkable amount of similarities with seismic imaging. In this presentation we show how tools from computational seismology can be transferred successfully to medical imaging. In particular, we discuss models and algorithmic strategies for the following steps towards creating a tomographic image of the human breast. First, a cost-effective acquisition geometry of sending and receiving ultrasound transducers is determined using experimental design. Second, we image sound speed using a ray-based method to create an initial reconstruction. In a third step, we improve the resolution of the image using waveform inversion governed by the acoustic wave equation. Here, we apply stochastic descent methods to efficiently solve the inverse problem and present numerical examples using Salvus.

Scalable Wave Propagation in Multiscale Media Based on a Pseudospectral/Spectral-Element Method with Particle Relabeling
Presenter:
Tarje Nissen-Meyer (University of Oxford, United Kingdom)
+ Abstract
We present a new numerical method to simulate seismic wave propagation in 3-D Earth models and finite boundary perturbations. Our method is a hybrid of pseudo-spectral and spectral element methods. We characterize the azimuthal wavefield dependence in terms of Fourier series, such that 3-D equations of motion reduce to an algebraic system of coupled 2-D meridional equations solved by a 2-D spectral element method. Computational efficiency of our method stems from lateral smoothness of Earth models which confine Fourier modes to few lower orders. Non-spherical boundary perturbations are considered by a Particle Relabeling Transformation. The MPI-based C++ code AxiSEM3D is available for 3-D models with fluid core, ellipticity, and both mantle and crustal structures. We show benchmarks for wave solutions in 3-D structures between AxiSEM3D and SPECFEM3D with remarkable agreement. Parallelization requires sophisticated load balancing due to locally varying Fourier expansion. The code scales excellently up to 13,000 cores (ARCHER).

A Spectral Finite Element Discretisation for Elastodynamics on Unstructured Triangle and Tetrahedral Meshes
Presenter:
Dave A. May (University of Oxford, United Kingdom)
+ Abstract
I will describe a continuous Galerkin spectral-element discretisation defined over triangles, or tetrahedra. The method uses a stable nodal basis and retains the accuracy and low dispersive properties of the classical SEM. However, the discretisation results in a non-diagonal mass matrix. I will describe an efficient preconditioned Krylov solver for the mass matrix operators which is robust with respect to the polynomial order, and possesses high arithmetic intensity. I will also describe a p-multigrid preconditioner which is effective for operators arising from implicit time-integrators. Implicit methods become relevant when using geometries defined by poor quality meshes, or if they contain elements with a wide range of length scales. The applicability of the new method will be demonstrated via several two- and three-dimensional wave-propagation scenarios. These scenarios will characterise the accuracy and cost of the method. Lastly, I will assess the potential benefits of using implicit time-integrators for regional-scale wave-propagation simulations.

We describe recent work within the GeoPC PASC project, synthesizing software components into a geophysical application. This work demonstrates the incorporation of several modern computational components into the application code pTatin3D for lithospheric dynamics. Our focus is to run realistic simulations at high efficiency on the Piz Daint supercomputer, leveraging its hybrid compute nodes to solve the nonlinear Stokes equations with complex rheologies.

Recent advances in algorithms, hardware, and microscopy enable more sophisticated and realistic simulations of tissue dynamics. A variety of simulation frameworks are being developed to capture different aspects of tissue dynamics.

Phase-Field Based Simulations of Embryonic Branching Morphogenesis
Presenter:
Lucas D. Wittwer (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
The mechanism that controls embryonic branching is not fully understood. Of all proposed mechanisms, only a Turing pattern-based model succeeds in predicting the location of newly emerging branches during lung and kidney branching morphogenesis. Turing models are based on at least two coupled non-linear reaction-diffusion equations. In case of the lung model, the two components (ligands and receptors) are produced in two different tissue layers. Thus the ligand is produced in the outer mesenchymal layer and the receptor is produced in the inner, branching epithelial layer; the diffusion of receptors is restricted to this epithelial layer. So far, numerical instabilities due to highly complex mesh deformations limit the maximal rounds of branching that can be simulated in an ALE-based framework. I will present our new Phase-Field-based framework for simulating embryonic lung morphogenesis and how we coupled the reaction-diffusion equations to the implicit domain.

Virtual Erythrocyte: Constitutive Relations and Fluid­cell Interactions
Presenter:
Sergey Litvinov (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Erythrocyte is a membrane separating two liquids. We focus on low Reynolds number flows which are relatively easy to model. The erythrocyte behavior is complex because of the membrane mechanics and its interactions with liquids. For a thin membrane, the motion is controlled by no slip with the external and the internal liquids, and Newton’s law – zero sum of liquid stresses, membrane stresses and acceleration. For Newtonian or Bingham solid membranes, if the membrane is kept spherical, the analytical solutions are known. In reality, the erythrocytes stress is a function of local strain and strain rate. We use particle methods to model erythrocyte. The advantage is the easy introduction of constitutive relationship, by prescribing interactions on a particle level. However there is no a-priori connection to macroscopic laws. We assess constitutive relations and fluid-membrane interactions, by comparing results with analytical solutions and experiments, using sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.

Cell Monolayer Mechanics and Acomys Spine Morphogenesis
Presenter:
Aziza Merzouki (University of Geneva, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
In this presentation, we introduce a 2D vertex model that we developed (based on Farhadifar et al., Curr. Biol., 2007) to simulate cell monolayers. The model includes cells’ mechanical properties, proliferation and signalling. It was used to study how cell biophysics affect the mechanical response of tissues to stretching, and inversely how tissue stretching may affect the mechanical properties of cells (Merzouki et al., Soft Matter, 2016). We simulated tissue stretching and calibrated our model parameters using the experimental stress-strain results of Harris et al., PNAS, 2012. We found that the parameters must vary with the tissue strain to be in agreement with the experiments. Finally, we also use the model to study the morphogenesis of Acomys Dimidiatus spines (Montandon et al., EvoDevo, 2014). We investigate how the signal that is produced by the Dermal Papilla cells and drives Matrix cell proliferation, may determine the final morphology of the follicles.

LBIBCell: A Cell-Based Simulation Framework to Explore the Impact of Cell Mechanics on Tissue Organisation and Growth
Presenter:
Dagmar Iber (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Our group has recently developed the 2D software framework, LBIBCell, to enable data-based simulations of tissue dynamics at cellular resolution. LBIBCell provides a very detailed simulation framework that represents the fluid-structure interaction between the elastic cell boundaries of the highly resolved polygonal cell geometries and the fluid inside and outside the cells. In the talk, I will introduce the software and present two examples of simulating epithelial tissue dynamics. Epithelia constitute the building blocks of organs throughout animals. Epithelial cells tightly adhere to their neighbours such that their apical surfaces form a polygonal lattice. The at-first-sight random arrangement of polygons exhibits some intriguing structure, and I will show how LBIBCell can be used to determine the underlying mechanism that gives rise to the observed order. Moreover, I will show how the software can be used to explore the impact of cell mechanics on growth pattern in epithelial tubes.

The complexities and nature of fluid flows imply that the resources needed to computationally model problems of industrial and academic relevance are virtually unbounded. CFD simulations, therefore, are a natural driver for exascale computing and have the potential for substantial societal impact, like reduced energy consumption, alternative sources of energy, improved health care, and improved climate models. Extreme scale CFD poses several cross-disciplinary challenges e.g. algorithmic issues in scalable solver design, handling of extreme sized data with compression and in-situ analysis, resilience and energy awareness in both hardware and algorithm design. The wide range of topics makes exascale CFD relevant to a wider HPC audience, extending outside the traditional fluid dynamics community. This minisymposium will be organized by the EU funded Horizon 2020 project ExaFLOW together with leading CFD experts from industry and will feature presentations showcasing their work on addressing key algorithmic challenges in CFD in order to facilitate simulations at exascale, e.g. accurate and scalable solvers, strategies to ensure fault tolerance and resilience. This session aims at bringing together the CFD community as a whole, from HPC experts to domain scientists, to discuss current and future challenges towards exascale fluid dynamics simulations and to facilitate international collaboration.

Towards Adaptive Meshes for the Spectral Element Code Nek5000
Presenter:
Philipp Schlatter (Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden)
+ Abstract
When performing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, the expected flow physics is often unknown. For this reason, the generation of a high-quality mesh is a complextask and is usually considered as a bottle-neck for any user of a CFD code. Ideally, the mesh should avoid unnecessary over-resolution in unimportant regions and require as few computational resources as possible. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques have been developed to tackle this issue by, first, identifying poorly resolved regions with effective error estimators and then, applying a mesh refinement strategy. In the present work, we propose to implement non-conforming mesh refinement within the code Nek5000: an open-source, highly scalable and portable code based on the spectral element method (SEM). We apply our techniques first to 2D flow configurations together with spectral and adjoint error estimators. In addition, we present an effective preconditioning using the Hypre library.

Delivering Performance Through HPC
Presenter:
Julien Hoessler (McLaren Racing Ltd, United Kingdom)
+ Abstract
Engineers commonly use computational fluid dynamics to understand the flow around prototype ideas and refine their designs. In an industry such as Formula One, where 2% of aerodynamics performance is the difference between being 1st and 10th, every design concept is firstly optimised in CFD. There is also an increasing appetite for more advanced CFD models being developed in academia, in particular time-resolved simulations because of the highly transient flow regimes we are dealing with. From our industry perspective, the development time scales also have to be taken into consideration: the full life of one of our race cars is a year, during which four to five major upgrades and their associated changes of aerodynamics concept will be considered. Thus, for time resolved CFD simulations to be accepted within our production process where the time scales are weeks, there is a strong need to be able to scale up simulations.

Multilevel Diskless Checksum Checkpoints for Automated Application Recovery
Presenter:

+ Abstract
Multilevel diskless checksum check-pointing is a novel approach for scalable resilience towards hard errors. Multilevel check-pointing has been shown to increase the overall efficiency of scientific codes in comparison with conventional single-stage check-pointing. It decreases the cost of check-pointing and recovery upon failure whilst also reducing the load on the parallel file-system. In this talk, we give a short introduction to the concept of multilevel check-pointing and present our experience implementing multilevel diskless checksum check-pointing in the Nektar++ spectral/hp element framework code using ULFM MPI. Furthermore, we will show preliminary findings on a novel algorithm for partial information recovery in incomplete checksums.

+ Abstract
As the HPC community looks towards the use of many-core technology to enable the next generation of supercomputers and bring an exascale facility towards becoming reality, there is a need to understand how this new paradigm maps to existing codes and algorithms that can already effectively utilize current generation HPC facilities. In this presentation, we present the approaches currently being undertaken inside the Nektar++ spectral/hp element framework to tackle this challenging issue. In particular, we will examine some of the key mathematical operations in the spectral/hp formulation, which form the basis of many scientific and engineering problems, and examine how these can be grouped collectively to make more efficient use of modern hardware. We will show how this collective nature provides a route through which we can tackle the challenge of many-core hardware in our existing codebase.

Climate & Weather
Weather and climate prediction centers face enormous challenges due to the rising cost of energy associated with running complex high-resolution forecast models on more and more processors and the likelihood that Moore's law will soon reach its limit, with microprocessor feature density (and performance) no longer doubling every two years. But the biggest challenge to state-of-the-art computational services arises from its own software productivity shortfall. The application software at the heart of all prediction services throughout Europe is ill-equipped to efficiently adapt to the rapidly evolving heterogeneous hardware provided by the supercomputing industry. The solution is not to reduce the stringent requirements for Earth-system prediction but to combine scientific and computer-science expertise for defining and co-designing the necessary steps towards affordable, exascale high-performance simulations of weather and climate. The Energy-efficient and Scalable Algorithms for weather Prediction and Exascale (ESCAPE) projects brings together a consortium of weather prediction centres operating at global as well as European regional scales, university institutes performing research on numerical methods and novel code optimization techniques, HPC centres with vast experience in scalable code development and diverse processor technologies, large HPC hardware vendor companies operating market leading systems, as well as a European start-up SME with novel and emerging optical processor technologies to address the challenge of extreme-scale, energy-efficient high-performance computing. Key objectives of ESCAPE are to (i) define fundamental algorithm building blocks (“weather & climate dwarfs”) to foster trans-disciplinary research and innovation and to co-design, advance, benchmark and efficiently run the next generation of NWP and climate models on energy-efficient, heterogeneous HPC architectures, to (ii) diagnose and classify weather and climate dwarfs on different HPC architectures, and to (iii) combine frontier research on algorithm development and extreme-scale, high-performance computing applications with novel hardware technology, to create a flexible and sustainable weather and climate prediction system. This minisymposium will present the current state of prediction model component developments of weather and climate dwarfs within and beyond ESCAPE, and the implications on performance and employed programming models. This session acts in close collaboration with the minisymposium on ‘Programming models and abstractions for weather and climate models: Today and in the futures’.

Weather and Climate Dwarfs: Definition, Code Design and Performance

+ Abstract
In the simulation of complex multiscale flow problems such as those arising in weather and climate modelling or engineering, one of the biggest challenges is to satisfy operational requirements in terms of time to solution and available energy without compromising the accuracy and stability of the solution. These two competing factors require extreme computational capabilities in conjunction with state-of-the-art algorithms that can optimally suit the targeted underlying hardware while improving the convergence to the desired solution. The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is leading the H2020 FET-HPC project ESCAPE of innovation actions for developing a holistic understanding of energy-efficiency for extreme-scale applications using heterogeneous architectures, accelerators and special compute units by (a) testing different numerical techniques, (b) combining frontier research on algorithm development, and (c) synthesizing the complementary skills of global NWP with leading European regional forecasting consortia, university research, experienced high-performance computing centres and hardware vendors.

The MPDATA Advection Dwarf of the High-Resolution Regional COSMO-EULAG model
Presenter:
Zbigniew Piotrowski (Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center, Poland)
+ Abstract
The MPDATA advection dwarf for structured grids is one of the two numerical machineries constituting the EULAG dynamical core of the high-resolution regional COSMO model aimed at Alpine weather prediction. To facilitate development and dissemination, the legacy MPDATA formulation was cast in the form of the independent dwarf with minimal set of the auxiliary subroutines leading to lightweight and flexible structure. The dwarf was equipped with a set of Cartesian and spherical idealized tests for verification against published results to ensure quality. Furthermore, the two versions of the MPDATA scheme were reformulated to expose stencil computations and improve computational intensity. Performance improvement is observed up to 250% and further developments are underway to compare the optimized Fortran with custom-made GPU/Phi implementations, as well as a DSEL GridTools port.

Multigrid Preconditioning of Elliptic Operators in High-Performance All-Scale Atmospheric Models
Presenter:
Mike Gillard (Loughborough University, United Kingdom)
+ Abstract
This paper discusses aspects of bespoke operator preconditioning for an elliptic solver, which forms part of the finite volume module (FVM). FVM is a dynamical core module being developed to be compatible with ECMWF’s Integrated Forecasting System. It is based on a non-hydrostatic solver for compressible Euler equations under gravity on a rotating sphere. FVM employs a non-oscillatory forward in time integrator that relies on MPDATA and a robust non-symmetric Krylov solver, formulated on arbitrary hybrid computational meshes discretising the generalised curvilinear framework of the computational space. In the presented work, FVM utilises hybrid unstructured meshes derived from the octahedral reduced Gaussian grid. In the Krylov solver, the preconditioner encompasses two aspects to address: stiffness due to the anisotropy of the atmosphere using a deflation approach, and stiffness due to the high-resolution horizontal discretisation scheme using multigrid. Theoretical considerations are illustrated with simulations of stratified turbulent flows and baroclinic instability.

Parallel-In-Time Integration with PFASST: The Hyperbolic Case
Presenter:
Robert Speck (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany)
+ Abstract
New parallel algorithms are required to unlock the computing power provided by massively parallel supercomputers for applications in science and engineering. For time-dependent PDEs, the "parallel full approximation scheme in space and time" (PFASST) can integrate multiple time-steps simultaneously, making use of different space-time coarsening strategies to improve parallel performance. Yet, as it is the case for many other parallel-in-time integration methods, PFASST works best for problems of diffusive type but shows poor performance for hyperbolic equations. In this talk, we briefly discuss previous results and benefits of PFASST and then formulate this algorithm as a multigrid method to provide an easy access to the mathematical analysis. In particular, using a customized local Fourier analysis, this approach allows us to analyze the convergence of PFASST in a semi-analytical manner for linear diffusion and advection, highlighting the difference between those two problems.

Organizer(s):

Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) is a recent but well established method for the analysis of problems governed by differential equations. Its goal is to reduce the gap between the worlds of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computer Aided Design (CAD). One of the key ideas in IgA is to use a common spline representation model for the design as well as for the analysis, providing a true design-through-analysis methodology. The IgA approach has been proved to be superior with respect to conventional FEA in various engineering application areas, including structural mechanics, electromagnetism, fluid-structure interaction. The keystones of this success are the many outstanding properties of the considered spline spaces and the associated B-spline basis. Spline representations allow for an efficient (geometric) manipulation, a high approximation power with respect to their degrees of freedom, appealing spectral properties, fast numerical linear algebra methods depending on spectral properties and/or tensor techniques. The minisymposium will address the most recent research directions and results related to 1) analysis of spectral properties in concrete applications 2) fast numerical linear algebra methods in connection with Bsplines, NURBS, extended spaces, etc.

Symbol Approach in IgA Matrix Analysis: from the Spectral Analysis to the Design of Fast Solvers
Presenter:
Carlo Garoni (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) is a paradigm for solving PDEs. Any discretization of a PDE for some sequence of stepsizes h tending to zero leads to a sequence of linear systems A_h * x_h = b_h, where dim(A_h) tends to 0 with h. For the solution of such linear systems, it is important to understand the spectral properties of the matrices A_h. In particular, the spectral distribution is a relevant concept. Roughly speaking, saying that the sequence {A_h}_h is distributed like the function f (called the symbol of {A_h}_h) means that the eigenvalues of A_h behave as a uniform sampling of f over its domain. In this talk we discuss the case of stiffness matrices arising from IgA: we compute and analyze their symbol and we use the information contained in the symbol to design a fast multi-iterative solver involving the PCG as a smoother in the multigrid procedure.

IGA for MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) Problems
Presenter:
Ahmed Ratnani (Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, Germany)
+ Abstract
Many aspects of the large-scale instabilities that appear in a magnetic confined plasma can be well described in the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) framework (with additional physics extensions). Solving these equations globally in the complicated geometry of a divertor tokamak or a stellerator is a highly demanding task due to the strong temporal and spatial multi-scale nature of the problem and the anisotropies reaching up to ten orders of magnitude which are introduced by the magnetic field. In general, explicit time integrators are not suitable while the use of implicit methods leads to very ill-conditioned matrices. In this talk we will cover some reduced MHD problems (in 2d and 3d), show different time integrations schemes and study the corresponding linear systems.

Optimal and Robust Multigrid for Isogeometric Analysis
Presenter:
Hendrik Speleers (University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy)
+ Abstract
In this talk we focus on the numerical solution of elliptic problems by means of isogeometric analysis. By exploiting specific spectral properties compactly described by a symbol, we are able to design efficient multigrid methods for the fast solution of the related linear systems. Despite the theoretical optimality, the convergence rate of two-grid methods with classical stationary smoothers worsens exponentially as the involved spline degrees increase. With the aid of the symbol, we can give a theoretical interpretation of this exponential worsening. Moreover, a proper factorization of the symbol allows us to develop a preconditioned conjugate gradient smoother, in the spirit of the multi-iterative strategy, that results in a good multigrid convergence rate, independent of both matrix size and spline degree. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposal and the numerical optimality. This is joint work with Marco Donatelli, Carlo Garoni, Carla Manni and Stefano Serra-Capizzano.

Spectral Analysis of the 2D Curl-Curl (Stabilized) Operator with Applications to the Related Iterative Solutions
Presenter:
Mariarosa Mazza (Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, Germany)
+ Abstract
In this work, we focus on the linear systems of equations arising from a compatible B-Splines discretization based on a discrete De Rham sequence of the 2D (stabilized) curl-curl operator. Such operator arises, e.g., in Time Harmonic Maxwell as well as in the MagnetoHydroDynamics. Our aim is to spectrally analyze the sequence of the coefficient matrices obtained when we refine the discretization mesh. In this view, we first recognize in the structure of the coefficient matrices a two-by-two pattern where each block is a two-level banded almost Toeplitz matrix whose bandwidths grow linearly with the degree of the B-splines. Then, we use the generalized locally Toeplitz theory to identify the so-called symbol of the coefficient matrix-sequence, a function which compactly describes its asymptotic spectral behavior. Finally, we employ the spectral information provided by the symbol to suggest proper iterative strategies for the numerical solution of the involved linear systems.

Kinetic simulations play an essential role towards understanding the dynamics of plasmas in the fields of nuclear fusion, laser plasma interaction, and astrophysics. The complexity of kinetic computations, in particular, their high dimensionality and multi-scale nature, lead to exciting challenges in physics, applied mathematics, and computer science. For example, modeling the plasma dynamics close to the edge of magnetic fusion devices requires codes which can flexibly handle complex geometries and implement enhanced gyrokinetic models or fully kinetic descriptions. Modern numerical tools such as multi-scale methods, structure-preserving schemes and isogeometric meshes, therefore, need to be adapted to plasma physics models in order to enhance state-of-the-art kinetic codes. At the same time, new programming models are necessary to prepare codes for the use on emerging heterogeneous HPC systems. This includes vectorization, cache efficient memory organization, task-based parallelism as well as new algorithms that are adapted to modern hardware. This minisymposium shall bring together scientists from physics, applied mathematics, and computer science to discuss current trends in the development of (gyro) kinetic codes.

A Conservative Exponential Integrator for the Drift-Kinetic Model
Presenter:
Lukas Einkemmer (University of Innsbruck, Austria)
+ Abstract
Splitting methods have been extensively used to solve kinetic equations such as the four-dimensional drift-kinetic model. These methods are attractive as they decompose the full problem into a sequence of lower dimensional advections which are then treated, for example, using a suitable semi-Lagrangian scheme. In this talk we propose a new exponential integrator based numerical approach that removes the most stringent CFL condition from the drift-kinetic equation. This method is computationally cheaper than the traditional splitting approach and is able to conserve mass up to machine precision (owing to an Arakawa type space discretization). Furthermore, we observe superior behavior with respect to the conservation of both the L^2 norm and energy.

Time Discretization of a Geometric Electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell Method
Presenter:
Katharina Kormann (Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, Germany)
+ Abstract
Numerical schemes that preserve the structure of the underlying kinetic equations can provide new insights into the long time behavior of fusion plasmas. In this talk we will present an electromagnetic particle-in-cell solver for the Vlasov-Maxwell equations that preserves at the discrete level the non-canonical Hamiltonian structure of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. The Maxwell's equations are discretized by compatible spline finite elements that yield discrete differential operators that retain properties like div curl = 0. Along with a classical particle discretization of the Vlasov equation, this yields a system of differential equations that has a Poisson structure, that is the non-canonical analog of a symplectic structure. We will discuss two time discretization schemes: an explicit Hamiltonian splitting that retains the Poisson structure and an energy-conserving semi-implicit scheme. Both schemes are compared in terms of their computational complexity and their time step restriction.

The Particle-In-Fourier (PIF) Approach Applied to Gyrokinetic Simulations and its Implementation on GPUs
Presenter:
Noé Ohana (EPFL, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
A widespread method for gyrokinetic simulations relies on the discretization of distribution functions with numerical markers. The electromagnetic field is represented by finite differences or finite elements (Particle-In-Cell, PIC). When simulating large-sized systems, this method encounters performance losses, both locally (intra-CPU) and globally (inter-CPU) because the amount of communicated data increases. Another approach, Particle-In-Fourier (PIF), takes advantage of the anisotropy of the field by representing it in Fourier space, where data is much smaller. One can scale up the system size keeping the number of particles per mode constant, and removing the subdomain decomposition, resulting in a better parallel scalability. The price to pay is the computation of sines and cosines at marker positions instead of low-order polynomials. GPUs are well suited to such high arithmetic intensity. We will show that PIF is advantageous over PIC for cases that do not require too large a number of modes.

InKS, a Programming Model to Decouple Semantics from Optimizations in HPC and its Application to the 6D Semi-Lagrangian Advection Use-Case
Presenter:
Ksander Ejjaaouani (INRIA, France)
+ Abstract
Supercomputer architectures are becoming increasingly complex, and developing high-performance simulations not only requires a deep understanding of the simulated domain but also of complex optimizations. This is made even more difficult due to the coexistence of multiple distinct architectures that evolve quickly. The mix of domain concerns and optimizations in codes leads to complexity and maintenance difficulties. In this talk, we present InKS (independent kernels scheduling), a programming model we design to decouple semantic from optimization choices. It supports the description of the semantics as a set of functions that operate on logically infinite arrays with pragma annotations to specify dependencies. The choices regarding mapping to memory and scheduling can be made independently. We implement a compiler for automatic execution and provide tools to enable optimization specialists to make the best possible choices. We evaluate our approach on a 6D vlasov-poisson solver for which optimizations are critical.

Within materials and cheminformatics, machine learning and inductive reasoning are known for their use in so-called structure property relationships. Despite a long tradition of these methods in pharmaceutical applications their overall usefulness for chemistry and materials science has been limited. Only over the last couple of years, a number of machine learning (ML) studies have appeared with the commonality that quantum mechanical or atomistically resolved properties are being analyzed or predicted based on regression models defined in compositional and configurational space. The atomistic framework is crucial for the unbiased exploration of this space since it enables, at least in principle, the free variation of chemical composition, atomic weights, structure, and electron number. Substantial CPU investments have to be made in order to obtain sufficient training data using atomistic simulation protocol. This minisymposium boasts four of the most active players in the field who share a common background in developing computationally demanding atomistic simulation methods, and who have contributed new and original work based on unsupervised (Ceriotti and Varma) as well as supervised (Ghiringhelli and von Lilienfeld) learning.

Big Data of Materials Science: Critical Role of the Descriptor
Presenter:
Luca Massimiliano Ghiringhelli (Fritz Haber Institute Berlin, Germany)
+ Abstract
Scientific discoveries often proceed from the accumulation of consistent data to the identification of functional dependencies among the data, i.e., a model that is able to predict yet unseen phenomena. A classical example is the periodic table of Mendeleev, empirically constructed from data on the chemistry of known elements. In the last decades, statistical learning has been developed in order to find optimal and stable functional dependencies among data. We present a bouquet of compressed-sensing and exploratory data-analysis based methodologies, for the identification of functional dependencies where the descriptor (the set of input variables of the functional dependence) is selected out of a dictionary of "well formed" candidate analytical expressions. Such candidates are constructed as nonlinear functions of a set of basic "physically meaningful" features, called primary features. Results from the application of the methods are presented for the crystal-structure and other properties prediction of binary materials.

Discerning Causalities in Protein Function using “Inverse” Machine Learning
Presenter:
Sameer Varma (University of South Florida, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Machine learning is traditionally used for classifying data. Here we present new developments where we use support vector machines, not for classification, but for repartitioning pre-classified data and for determining causalities in data. These developments provide us with a unique set of solutions to address challenges facing the study of many major protein families, including GPCRs, NTFs, HSPs and Igs. The thermodynamic states of these proteins cannot be differentiated solely on the basis of their representative 3D structures, as inter-state structural differences are small and differences in structural fluctuations also matter. Consequently, their mechanisms cannot be understood in terms of how their 3D structures differ between states, and new methods are required to statistically analyze differences between high-dimensional structural ensembles and also relate differences to function. Our new “inverse” machine learning based solutions accomplish just this, and have begun to provide molecular insights into their underlying mechanisms.

Quantum Machine Learning
Presenter:
Anatole von Lilienfeld (University of Basel, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Many of the most relevant chemical properties of matter depend explicitly on atomistic and electronic details, rendering a first principles approach to chemistry mandatory. Alas, even when using high-performance computers, brute force high-throughput screening of compounds is beyond any capacity for all but the simplest systems and properties due to the combinatorial nature of chemical space, i.e. all compositional, constitutional, and conformational isomers. Consequently, efficient exploration algorithms need to exploit all implicit redundancies present in chemical space. I will discuss recently developed statistical learning approaches for interpolating quantum mechanical observables in compositional and constitutional space.

Mapping Molecular Landscapes, from the Gas Phase to Crystals
Presenter:
Michele Ceriotti (EPFL, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Machine-learning algorithms provide a strategy to rationalize the structure-property relations in materials, as well as to predict the stability and properties of a given structure. I will present examples of how non-linear dimensionality reduction can be used to give insight into the main motifs that characterize molecular compounds. I will begin by demonstrating the application of these techniques to a database of aminoacids in the gas phase, and then discuss how they can be extended to molecular crystals, focusing in particular on materials for organic electronics.

In the minisymposium "Parallel Numerical Linear Algebra" we will present two major problems. The first part concentrates on dense eigenvalue solvers and is based on the work of the ELPA-AEO project. The underlying problems are Hermitian generalized eigenvalue problems and the parallel computation of a large part of the spectrum. The talks will present theoretical results and practical implementations. The second topic is the parallel solution of systems of linear equations. Here, the first talk will consider the parallelization of smoothers in Multigrid methods. The second talk will present parallel preconditioners based on ILU; here, the resulting sparse triangular systems are preconditioned and can be solved iteratively to achieve efficient parallel methods.

Improving Scalability and Efficiency of Multigrid Methods by Block-Smoothers
Presenter:
Matthias Bolten (University of Kassel, Germany)
+ Abstract
While multigrid methods show an excellent scaling behavior depending on the number of cores only logarithmically, on large-scale supercomputers this logarithmic dependency is visible. To reduce influence of this dependence, the amount of work being carried out on the coarse levels has to be reduced. This can be achieved by applying aggressive coarsening, effectively reducing the number of coarse levels. While this is easily possible in a geometric multigrid setting, the overall performance of the method will deteriorate, as the size of the coarse space is reduced. To retain a good convergence rate, the smoothing procedure has to be improved. We propose to use block smoothers to accomplish this; at the same time this results in a higher locality of the operations performed and thus in a better exploitation of modern computer architectures.

Iterative Parallel Methods for Deriving ILU-type Preconditioners
Presenter:
Thomas Huckle (TU Munich, Germany)
+ Abstract
ILU-type preconditioners are efficient preconditioners for solving systems of linear equations iteratively. In recent work by E. Chow it had been shown that they can be generated effectively in parallel based on a fixed point equation for (A − LU )_S = 0 as function f of L and U on pattern S. Here, we generalize this approach to modified ILU and by using Newton's method for finding the zero of f. Furthermore, ILU preconditioners lead to triangular systems that have to be solved in parallel. Here, we discuss different iterative schemes for solving triangular systems.

Efficient Reduction of Generalized hpd Eigenproblems
Presenter:
Valeriy Manin (University of Wuppertal, Germany)
+ Abstract
The standard approach for solving dense generalized eigenvalue problems Ax = eBx with hermitian A and hermitian positive definite B first reduces the problem to a standard eigenproblem Cz = ez, where, e.g., C = inv(L) A inv(L*), z = L* x, and L is obtained from a Cholesky decomposition B = L L* with L* being its hermitian transpose. There are several ways to compute C, and parallelized routines for this task are available in the ScaLAPACK, Elemental, and ELPA libraries. We combine ideas from these methods for optimizing data accesses and communication and present additional approaches for increasing the performance.

Efficient Transformation of the General Eigenproblem with Symmetric Banded Matrices to a Banded Standard Eigenproblem
Presenter:
Michael Rippl (TU Munich, Germany)
+ Abstract
The solution of symmetric eigenproblems plays a key role in many computational simulations. Generalized eigenproblems are transformed to a standard problem. This transformation has the drawback that for banded matrices in the generalized eigenproblem the banded structure is not preserved. The matrix of the standard eigenproblem will generally be a full matrix. We followed the ideas of the group of Lang (University of Wuppertal) who modified Crawford's algorithm and implemented this procedure in the ELPA project. By keeping the banded structure we save one reduction step on the matrix and one backtransformation step for the eigenvectors. This provides a good speedup compared to the standard tranformation procedure with Cholesky factorization.

PNL01 Beyond Moore's Law
Chair:
John Shalf (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, United States of America)
By most accounts, we are nearing the limits of conventional photolithography processes. It will be challenging to continue to shrink feature sizes smaller than 5nm and still realize any performance improvement for digital electronics in silicon. At the current rate of development, the purported “End of Moore’s Law” will be reached in the middle to end of next decade. Shrinking the feature sizes of wires and transistors has been the driver for Moore’s Law for the past 5 decades, but what might lie beyond the end of current lithographic roadmaps and how will it affect computing as we know it? Moore’s Law is an economic theory after all, and any option that can make future computing more capable each new generation (by some measure) could continue Moore’s economic theory well into the future. The goal of this panel session is to communicate the options for extending computing beyond the end of our current silicon lithography roadmaps. The correct answers may be found in new ways to extend digital electronics efficiency or capability, or even new models of computation such as neuromorphic and quantum.

Directing Matter: Toward Atomic-Scale 3D Nanofabrication for Beyond Moore’s Law Devices
Presenter:
Olga Ovchinnikova (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, United States of America)
+ Abstract
+ Biography
To move beyond current technologies, design of both silicon-based and functional materials requires material control on the level of individual atomic configurations and single atom positions. This is also important for understanding and harnessing energy where disruptive improvements in efficiencies are required. Achieving this ultimate limit in science and technology of material and device performance–from quantum computing to nonvolatile memories, from thermoelectrics to superconductors, requires design and control of matter with atomic, molecular, and mesoscale fidelity by developing precision synthesis tools. Here I will discuss development of pathways to direct matter in a scalable fashion to fabricate/design three-dimensional structures of a variety of materials with atom-by-atom and defect control of their shape and composition.

Opportunities and Challenges in the Area of Quantum Computing and Quantum Simulation
Presenter:
Thomas Lippert (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany)
+ Abstract
+ Biography
The development of quantum mechanics gave not only a new understanding of the physical world but also a new paradigm for computing. A quantum computer harnesses quantum effects to achieve a speedup against classical computers. This panel will discuss the future application fields of quantum computers and remaining challenges for building a large scale quantum computer.
Arguably the most prominent example is Shor’s algorithm which on a quantum computer is exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm for factoring integers. Much more interestingly, quantum computers can exponentially speedup calculations in quantum chemistry and materials science, which occupy a large fraction of today’s supercomputers. Already a medium sized quantum computer will be able to reach beyond classical exascale machines for such applications. Further potential application areas are the efficient solution of linear systems and accelerating stochastic simulations.

Neuromorphic Computing – Achievements, Opportunities and Plans
Presenter:
Karlheinz Meier (University of Heidelberg, Germany)
+ Abstract
+ Biography
The brain is characterized by extreme power efficiency, fault tolerance, compactness and the ability to learn. It can make predictions from noisy and unexpected input data. Any artificial system implementing all or some of those features is likely to have a large impact on the way we process information. With the increasingly detailed data from neuroscience and the availability of advanced VLSI process nodes the dream of building physical models of neural circuits on a meaningful scale of complexity is coming closer to realization. Such models deviate strongly from classical processor-memory based numerical machines as the two functions merge into a massively parallel network of almost identical cells. Neuromorphic architectures are considered an attractive approach to implement cognitive computing in hardware. Recent implementations of deep learning with convolutional neural networks on traditional architectures have shown remarkable results which have led to a debate on whether more biological detail like spike communication would be useful or just a burden. This panel will discuss this open question and argue for a systematic approach towards neuromorphic architectures with an optimized degree of biological realism. This panel will introduce current projects worldwide and the approach proposed by the EU Human Brain Project to establish a systematic path from biological data to brain derived neuromorphic machines with a very high degree of configurability.

Cosmology is in a scientifically very exciting phase. Two decades of surveying the sky have culminated in the celebrated Cosmological Standard Model. Yet, two of its key pillars, dark matter and dark energy, remain mysterious. Deep fundamental questions demand answers; to address these burning questions, survey capabilities are being exponentially improved. The new observations will pose tremendous challenges on many fronts – from the sheer size of the data that will be collected to its modeling and interpretation. The interpretation of the data requires sophisticated simulations on the world’s largest supercomputers.

+ Abstract
+ Paper
ABCpy is a highly modular, scientific library for ApproximateBayesian Computation (ABC) written in Python. The main contributionof this paper is to document a software engineering effortthat enables domain scientists to easily apply ABC to their researchwithout being ABC experts; using ABCpy they can easily run largeparallel simulations without much knowledge about parallelization,even without much additional effort to parallelize their code. Further,ABCpy enables ABC experts to easily develop new inferenceschemes and evaluate them in a standardized environment, andto extend the library with new algorithms. These benefits comemainly from the modularity of ABCpy. We give an overview ofthe design of ABCpy, and we provide a performance evaluationconcentrating on parallelization.

+ Abstract
+ Paper
We report a new multicanonical Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm toobtain the density of states (DOS) for physical systems with continuousstate variables in statistical mechanics. Our algorithm is ableto obtain an analytical form for the DOS expressed in a chosen basisset, instead of a numerical array of finite resolution as in previousvariants of this class of MC methods such as the multicanonical(MUCA) sampling and Wang-Landau (WL) sampling. This is enabledby storing the visited states directly in a data set and avoidingthe explicit collection of a histogram. This practice also has theadvantage of avoiding undesirable artificial errors caused by thediscretization and binning of continuous state variables. Our resultsshow that this scheme is capable of obtaining converged resultswith a much reduced number of Monte Carlo steps, leading to asignificant speedup over existing algorithms.

The computation of bulks of inner eigenpairs of large sparse matrices is known to be both an algorithmic challenge and resource intensive in terms of compute power. As the compute capabilities have continuously increased over the past decades, computational models or applications requiring information about inner eigenstates of sparse matrices have become numerically accessible in many research fields. At the same time new algorithms (e.g. FEAST or SSM) have been introduced and long-standing methods such as filter diagonalization are still being applied, improved and extended. However, the trend towards highly parallel (heterogeneous) compute systems is challenging the efficiency of existing solver packages as well as building block libraries, and calls for new massively parallel solvers with high hardware efficiency across different architectures. Thus, substantial effort is put into the implementation of new sparse (eigen)solver frameworks which face challenges in terms of ease of use, extendibility, sustainability and hardware efficiency. Software engineering and holistic performance engineering concepts are deployed to address these challenges. The significant momentum in the application fields, numerical methods and software layers calls for a strong interaction between scientists involved in those activities to provide sustainable and hardware efficient frameworks to compute inner eigenvalues of large sparse matrices. The minisymposium offers a platform to bring together leading experts in this field to discuss recent developments at all levels: from the application down to hardware efficient implementations of basic kernel operations. Application experts will present their current and upcoming research requiring the computation of inner eigenvalues. State-of-the-art eigensolvers and new algorithmic developments will be discussed along with challenges faced by library developers in terms of software sustainability and hardware efficiency. Many of these topics are not limited to the inner sparse eigenvalue problems but are of general interest for sparse linear algebra algorithms for current and future HPC architectures. Part 1 of the minisymposium focuses on applications and algorithms.

Interior Eigenvalue and Eigenvalue Density Computations in Quantum Physics Applications
Presenter:
Andreas Alvermann (University of Greifswald, Germany)
+ Abstract
Computation of the eigenvalues or spectrum of a Hermitian matrix is a fundamental task in numerical quantum physics. With the advent of topological materials such as graphene, extraction of the interior part of the spectrum has moved into focus. In my talk I will discuss two techniques that address this challenge. The first technique, known as the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM), allows for the computation of spectral functions, for example, the eigenvalue density, without having to determine individual eigenvalues. The second technique, which we call Chebyshev filter diagonalization (ChebFD), is dedicated to the computation of a large number of interior eigenvalues. Both techniques draw their strength from Chebyshev polynomials and require the respective matrix only through matrix-vector multiplication. After discussion of the algorithmic background of these techniques, including the optimal choice of polynomials, I will address some specific application-related aspects, e.g., how the ChebFD convergence depends on the eigenvalue density.

Nonlinear Sakurai-Sugiura Method for Electronic Transport Calculation on KNL Cluster
Presenter:
Tetsuya Sakurai (University of Tsukuba, Japan)
+ Abstract
Electronic transport calculations require the computation of eigenvalues located in a ring region and their corresponding eigenvectors of a quadratic eigenvalue problem with T-palindromic structure. In this talk, we propose a technique for solving such quadratic problems by using the nonlinear Sakurai-Sugiura method. The proposed method reduces computational costs using a T-palindromic structure and achieves high parallel efficiency by using a contour integral. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on Knights Landing cluster, Oakforest-PACS, in Japan.

Extremely Large Quantum Material Simulations with Novel Linear Algebraic Algorithms and Massively Parallel Supercomputers
Presenter:
Takeo Hoshi (Tottori University, Japan)
+ Abstract
A novel linear-algebraic algorithm realizes extremely large quantum material simulations (electronic state calculations) with 10^8 atoms or 100-nm-scale materials. The mathematical foundation is generalized shifted linear equations ( ( z B – A ) x = b ), instead of conventional generalized eigenvalue equations ( A y = e B y ) . The method has a highly parallelizable mathematical structure. The fundamental theory is general and is applicable also to other scientific fields. The benchmark shows an extreme strong scaling and a qualified time-to-solution on the full system of the K computer. The method was demonstrated in a real material research for ultra-flexible (organic) devices that play a crucial role in next-generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) products like display, sensor, and battery. Related methods are also presented. The present contribution shows that an innovative scalable algorithm for a real research problem can appear by the co-design among application, algorithm, and architecture.

Rational and Polynomial Filtering for Eigenvalue Problems and the EVSL Project
Presenter:
Yousef Saad (University of Minnesota, United States of America)
+ Abstract
The presentation will begin with an overview of polynomial filteringtechniques in the context of spectrum slicing for eigenvalue problem, i.e., the technique of computing slices of the spectrum independently. This general approach can be quite efficient in the situation where the matrix-vector product operation is inexpensive and when a large number of eigenvalues is sought. We present an algorithm (and package) that combines the Lanczos algorithm with partial reorthogonalization and polynomial filtering. An alternative to polynomial filtering that is generating a growing interest is a class of methods that exploit filtering by rational functions. Here we will argue that the standard way of selecting these rational filters, which is based on using the Cauchy integral, can be substantially improved – especially when iterative solvers are involved.

In this series of two minisymposia, a special focus lies on providing a platform for exchanging ideas about scalable, memory-efficient, fast and resilient solving techniques. These characteristics are crucial for science and engineering-driven applications making use of exascale computing like geophysics, astrophysics, aerodynamics, etc. Algorithms in high-performance computing require a rethinking of the standard approaches to ensure on the one hand the full usage of the future computing power, and on the other hand energy-efficiency. A careful implementation of all performance-relevant parts and an intelligent combination with external libraries is fundamental for exascale computation. Multigrid and domain decomposition play an important role in many scientific applications and have often developed ideas separately using the immense compute power of supercomputers. The minisymposia address both communities and focus on exchanging current research progress related to exascale enabled solving techniques.

The Uintah software at the University of Utah is presently being used to solve a very large simulation problem relating to a clean-coal boiler with a combustion chamber of about 20000 cubic metres. A primary mechanism for heat transfer in such a boiler is thermal radiation. In order to make thermal radiation scale on present and future parallel machines, we adopt a ray-tracing approach coupled to multiple grid levels to reduce the communications costs. We will present an analysis of this approach and demonstrate scaling results on DOE's Titan computer. We will also explain the challenges that occur when using this method for real live industrial scale problems and how these are overcome on both GPUs and Xeon Phi KNL.

Linear Solvers at Scale: Numerical Scalability and Resiliency Inside!
Presenter:
Matthieu Kuhn (INRIA, France)
+ Abstract
In this talk we will present an algebraic Domain Decomposition solver for general matrices that can be fully algebraically equipped with a coarse space mechanism to be numerically scalable on general SPD systems. While many of these solvers DDM fall in Abstract Schwarz framework, their robustness has often been demonstrated on a case-by-case basis. Extending the GenEO method, we propose a bound for the condition number of all deflated AS methods provided that the coarse grid consists of the assembly of local components that contain low-energy modes of some local operators. We furthermore discuss and illustrate the resiliency capability that can be embedded to address hard faults, exploiting the natural redundancy or the preconditioner to implement recovery; or numerical criteria to detect soft-errors, exploiting spectral bound naturally provided by the coarse space correction. Parallel numerical experiments will be given to illustrate the robustness of the resulting algorithms.

Fast and Scalable Multigrid Solver Employing Agglomeration Techniques
Presenter:
Markus Huber (TU Munich, Germany)
+ Abstract
Reaching the exascale computing era, algorithms with optimal complexity such as multigrid methods are essential for exploiting the available parallel compute power. Over the last decade we developed a parallel high-performance multigrid framework called hierarchical hybrid grids (HHG). We focused especially on sophisticated data structures, efficient communication routines, the elimination of serial performance bottlenecks and low-level optimization. Using this well-designed framework, we investigated in the area of curved boundaries, large viscosity contrast problems and complex modeling questions arising from geophysical applications. In this talk, we present our new achievements in reducing communication bottlenecks in coarse level solves, using special agglomeration techniques in combination with robust coarse level solvers of well-elaborated scientific high-performance computing libraries (PETSc and MUMPS). We show scalability results with special focus on time-to-solution on two state-of-the-art petascale supercomputers. In addition, we apply these strategies to a stationary Stokes problem as a typical geophysical test scenario.

Multigrid Preconditioners for High Order Finite Element Discretisations
Presenter:
Dave A. May (University of Oxford, United Kingdom)
+ Abstract
In this talk I will describe and examine the performance of a particular type of geometric multigrid preconditioner designed for high-order continuous Galerkin finite element discretisations on meshes of unstructured triangle / tetrahedra, and or quadrilateral / hexahedral. The construction of the Galerkin coarse grid operators, application of the restriction and prolongation operators and application of the smoother almost entirely rely on purely local operations (element-wise, or over a patch of elements). Such characteristics make the method amenable to hardware accelerators. Interestingly, the methodology is particularly simple to implement and can be introduced into existing high order finite element software in a non-invasive manner. Through a number of numerical experiments, the versatility and robustness of the preconditioner will be demonstrated.

Organizer(s):
Stephan Brunner (EPFL, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Physics, Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
Kinetic simulations play an essential role towards understanding the dynamics of plasmas in the fields of nuclear fusion, laser plasma interaction, and astrophysics. The complexity of kinetic computations, in particular, their high dimensionality and multi-scale nature, lead to exciting challenges in physics, applied mathematics, and computer science. For example, modeling the plasma dynamics close to the edge of magnetic fusion devices requires codes which can flexibly handle complex geometries and implement enhanced gyrokinetic models or fully kinetic descriptions. Modern numerical tools such as multi-scale methods, structure-preserving schemes and isogeometric meshes, therefore, need to be adapted to plasma physics models in order to enhance state-of-the-art kinetic codes. At the same time, new programming models are necessary to prepare codes for the use on emerging heterogeneous HPC systems. This includes vectorization, cache efficient memory organization, task-based parallelism as well as new algorithms that are adapted to modern hardware.

Computational Challenges Towards Strong Scaling Gyrokinetic Eulerian Codes at Exa-scale
Presenter:
Yasuhiro Idomura (Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Japan)
+ Abstract
Turbulent transport is one of the key issues in fusion science. To address this issue via a five-dimensional gyrokinetic model, the Gyrokinetic Toroidal 5D full-f Eulerian code GT5D has been developed. On the K-computer, inter-node parallelization techniques such as multi-dimensional/-layer domain decomposition and communication-computation overlap were developed, and strong scaling of GT5D was improved up to 73,728 nodes. This computing power enabled us to study ITER relevant issues such as the plasma size scaling of turbulent transport. However, extensions of GT5D towards burning plasmas including kinetic electrons and multi-species ions require greater computing power. Under the post-K project (Japanese Exa-scale computing project), we have developed computing techniques for next generation platforms such as GPUs and many core processors. In this talk, we discuss computational challenges related to complicated intra-node memory hierarchy and relatively limited inter-node communication performance compared with accelerated computation.

Status of the Exascale Computing Project on High-Fidelity Whole Device Modeling of Magnetically Confined Fusion Plasma
Presenter:
Stephane Ethier (Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, United States of America)
+ Abstract
2016 has seen the start of an ambitious new initiative at the US Department of Energy: The Exascale Computing Project (https://exascaleproject.org). ECP brings together domain scientists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers to work in collaboration to accelerate the development of exascale hardware and software. On the software side, 15 applications were fully funded (+7 seed efforts), as well as 4 “co-design” centers and 35 software development projects. This presentation will give an insider’s view of the exascale project and, in particular, of the funded application on “High-Fidelity Whole Device Modeling of Magnetically Confined Fusion Plasma”. This project aims at developing an exascale-ready framework for the whole-device simulation of tokamak fusion devices. One of the main tasks in this effort is the coupling of the core turbulence delta-f code GENE with the edge turbulence total-f code XGC1.

Gyrokinetic Global Electromagnetic Simulations with ORB5 and GENE.
Presenter:
Natalia Tronko (Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, Germany)
+ Abstract
Access to HPC facilities has allowed gyrokinetic (GK) codes to be taken to significantly more advanced levels of realism. We present a new two-fold (theoretical and numerical) generic framework for GK code verification; the multi-species electromagnetic ORB5 (PIC) and the global version of GENE (Eulerian) are considered as examples. The first part of this work contains a common theoretical framework for the systematic derivation of the ORB5 and GENE code models, while the second part is dedicated to the inter-code benchmark. A detailed analysis of micro-instabilities identified the main numerical difficulties such as requirement of a large radial resolution. Detailed verifications of global electromagnetic test cases developed from the CYCLONE Base Case are considered, including a parametric β-scan covering the transition from ITG to KBM and the spectral properties at the nominal β value. First results of transition towards turbulence regime within the same setup are presented

Beyond Electrodynamics with PIConGPU: Performance Portable, Open Multi-Physics HPC Simulations for Laser-Plasma Experiments at the European XFEL
Presenter:
Axel Huebl (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Germany)
+ Abstract
PIConGPU is reportedly the fastest electro-magnetic particle-in-cell code in the world in terms of sustained Flop/s. Its computational power does not only enable 3D3V simulations with unprecedented detail and fast time-to-solution but also allows improving predictive capabilities of simulations by estimating stochastic and systematic errors via repeated simulations. Synthetic in-situ diagnostics drive the exploration of high-detail simulations whose signatures, e.g. emitted radiation spectra, would be inaccessible in post-processing due to sheer data size. Upcoming experiments at the European XFEL require us to take PIConGPU one step further: modeling XFEL-matter interaction on top of laser-driven particle acceleration processes requires the introduction of non-trivial X-ray photon scattering, photon generation, and advanced non-LTE atomic models. Coupled with an open-science centered strategy, from open performance portable source code over open standardized data formats to documented workflows for PByte scale simulation we strive towards a new quality of predictive, reproducible simulations within our community.

The design of materials for energy production and storage is a subject of great scientific and technological interest and its potential impact on society is very great indeed. The study of such systems is however rather challenging since the systems are complicated. Modeling of such systems poses a challenge since one deals with systems in which reactions take place at surfaces in the presence of highly disordered environments. Car-Parrinello type simulations combined with  ab-initio  methods are of course needed. In this minisymposium we invite specialists to discuss the perculiar challenges in this field. The issues that we expect to cover will be oxidation processes in solution, electron transfer, morphology and chemistry at the interfaces.

Accelerating Rare Events in Electrochemistry
Presenter:
Marta Bon (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is widely regarded as one of the most suitable devices by virtue of its advantages in long life cycle, low costs, low environmental footprint, flexibility in scale-up and ease of maintenance. Several key factors influence the energy and power density of VRFBs (e.g. the electrolyte speciation, electrode surface, and membranes). Despite the several studies conducted until now, some mechanisms occurring in these electrochemical cells are still not completely clear. In this sense, ab-initio Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation can provide a precious contribution, because it offers the possibility to investigate at the molecular level the fundamental interactions (e.g. solute-solvent, solute-electrode, solute-membrane) ruling the overall mechanism. However, these dynamical processes often take place in time-scales normally not accessible with standard MD. Metadynamics addresses this intrinsic time-scale limitation. I will briefly introduce this technique, focusing on its use to describe the most important interactions occurring in VRFBs.

Nature-Inspired Water Splitting for Sustainable Hydrogen Production
Presenter:
Sandra Luber (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Solar energy is an inexhaustible energy source for a sustainable solution to the global energy consumption. Artificial photosynthesis permits the splitting of water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen and is, therefore, a very promising strategy to meet the increasing worldwide need for clean energy. This requires the development of efficient water-reduction and water-oxidation catalysts (WOCs) where the latter is currently the main bottleneck for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Very recently, the first Co(II)-based cubane WOCs have been presented, which excel through unprecedented structural analogies to the oxygen-evolving complex of nature’s photosystem II. We study their properties and catalytic behavior by means of high-level density functional theory (DFT) and DFT-based molecular dynamics. Moreover, structurally simpler Co-based WOCs are investigated in detail. The insight gained from the calculations paves the way for the derivation of important structure-activity relationships essential for informed design of novel high-performance WOCs.

Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics of Liquids: From CO2 Conversion to Osmotic Energy Conversion
Presenter:
Rodolphe Vuilleumier (Pierre and Marie Curie University, France)
+ Abstract
Many chemical processes involved in energy production occur in the liquid state or at liquid interfaces. Here we will discuss how ab initio Molecular Dynamics allows to describe these processes at ambient and at elevated temperatures. We will show how it can gives mechanistic insights as well as recent progress towards multi-scale simulations and the calculation of thermodynamical quantities. We will mainly consider two examples: first, molten carbonates that are used as electrolyte for molten salt fuel cells and have been proposed for elctrochemical conversion of CO2, and second, osmotic energy conversion by chemisorption of hydroxide on boron nitride membranes.

An Unstructured-Mesh Generator Based on SPH Analogy
Presenter:
Lin Fu (TU Munich, Germany)
+ Abstract
We propose a novel unstructured mesh generation method based on SPH analogy. An adapted isotropic mesh is generated by three steps. First, three field variables are introduced to define the target mesh-vertex distribution along with their governing transport equations. Second, a particle-relaxation process is defined and solved numerically by an SPH method such that the final particle distribution conforms to the mesh-quality target functions and satisfies isotropy and smoothness criteria. Third, the unstructured mesh is generated from the particle distribution by Delaunay triangulation. We demonstrate that the method produces high-quality unstructured meshes for complex domain boundaries. In particular, we find that the meshes optimally satisfy multiple quality criteria.

Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics with Angular Momentum Conservation
Presenter:
Dmitry Fedosov (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany)
+ Abstract
Smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) combines two popular mesoscopic techniques, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) methods, and can be considered as an improved DPD approach. Despite several advantages of the SDPD method over the conventional DPD model, the current formulation of SDPD lacks angular momentum conservation, leading to unphysical results for problems where the conservation of angular momentum is essential. To overcome this limitation, we extend the SDPD method by introducing a particle spin variable such that local and global angular momentum conservation is restored. We test the new method and demonstrate that it properly reproduces fluid transport coefficients. We also employ the new SDPD formulation for modeling the dynamics of blood cells. In conclusion, the extended SDPD method with angular momentum conservation provides a new approach to tackle fluid problems such as multiphase flows and vesicle/cell suspensions, where the conservation of angular momentum is essential.

Hybrid Simulation of Turbulent Wake Vortices with Rain
Presenter:
Philippe Billuart (Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium)
+ Abstract
Wake related separations increasingly become a capacity-limiting factor in air traffic. The SESAR project aims at modernizing the European airspace and safely increasing its capacity. This includes the use, in real time, of Lidar and Radar to detect and alert of hazardous wake situations. In rainy weather, the back-scattered power seen by radar is mostly function of the raindrop concentration and diameter distribution, thus motivating the prediction of the return signal due to raindrops caught within turbulent wake vortices. The present work aims at correlating the vortex intensity and the radar signal through simulation. The large number of raindrops motivates an approach based on continuum fields. The turbulent flow and the raindrop velocities are simulated using a pseudo-spectral solver while a remeshed particle method is used for the raindrop concentration. The non-zero divergence of the raindrop velocity field imposes special treatments to prevent oscillations and negative concentrations.

Coarse-Grained Protein Model for Dissipative Particle Dynamics
Presenter:
Igor V. Pivkin (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
We developed a coarse-grained protein model for Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) method, which employs long-range electrostatics and Drude oscillators. The model allows sequence specific modeling of proteins on timescales larger than currently accessible by conventional methods. The model is also free from elastic network restraints needed to keep the secondary structure stable, which we consider as a strong advantage.

Climate & Weather
Progress in weather and climate modeling is tightly linked to the increase in computing resources available for such models. Emerging heterogeneous high-performance architectures are a unique opportunity to address these requirements in an energy- and time-efficient manner. The hardware changes of emerging computing platforms are accompanied by dramatic changes in programming paradigms. These changes have only just started. Adapting current weather and climate codes to efficiently exploit such architectures requires an effort which is both costly and error-prone. The long software lifecycles of weather and climate codes renders the situation even more critical, as hardware life cycles are much shorter in comparison. Furthermore, atmospheric models are developed and used by a large variety of researchers on a myriad of computing platforms, which makes portability a crucial requirement in any kind of development. Developers of weather and climate models are struggling to achieve a better separation of concerns in order to separate the high-level specification of equations and solution algorithms from the hardware dependent, optimized low-level implementation. It is probable that the solutions to achieve this will be different for different parts of the codes, due to different predominant algorithmic motifs and data-structures. On the example of concrete porting efforts, this session will illustrate different approaches used today and (possibly) in the future.

The CLAW Compiler: Abstractions for Weather and Climate Models
Presenter:
Valentin Clément (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Adapting complex code to take advantage of new computing HPC architectures is a cumbersome task. The development life cycle of weather models does not match the fast pace of the new hardware releases. Therefore, restructuring the code and applying specific architecture optimization is often needed to get optimal performance when porting models to those new architectures. This leads to multiple specific versions of the same code optimized for a single target supercomputer and not portable among them. In order to keep a single source code and get performance portability on different hardware, we propose a one-column model abstraction for physical parameterizations. It supports domain scientists who do not want to be concerned about HPC optimizations for multiple columns. We are developing a directive language and a tool named CLAW that is able to apply automatic code transformation on abstracted code to produce parallelized versions for dedicated target architecture.

Performance Portable Acceleration of Weather and Climate Dwarfs
Presenter:
Peter Messmer (NVIDIA Inc., Switzerland)
+ Abstract
The life-time of weather and climate codes often spans several processor generations, making it difficult to introduce code optimizations targeting single hardware platform. And yet, the scientific missions requires these applications to run at very high performance on a broad range of hardware. Applications therefore need to be written abstractly enough to guarantee portability while expressively enough to enable high performance. OpenACC and OpenMP are well established standards for expressing parallelism and data locality, whereas data management layers like Atlas or GridTools offer target independent data structures. Within the ESCAPE project we therefore investigate whether these tools meet the performance and portability requirements of the weather and climate community. Isolating core algorithmic motifs of operational models into so-called dwarfs, we can quickly explore and compare different implementations. In this talk we will discuss results of optimization efforts on CPUs, CPU+Xeon Phi and GPUs, using different performance portable approaches.

Performance Portable Dynamical Cores on Irregular Grids Using Domain Specific Languages
Presenter:
Carlos Osuna Escamilla (MeteoSwiss, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Numerical weather prediction and climate models are large parallel applications that need to simulate complex physical phenomena within tight production schedules. In search of improving prediction accuracy, weather models are continuously exploring new discretization methods and increasing the spatial resolution, which results in an ever increasing demand for more computing power and efficient codes that can leverage non traditional computing architectures. Porting large weather codes to heterogeneous architectures preserving a single, efficient source code can be a daunting process. The ESCAPE project develops methods and algorithms for high performance weather applications, with an emphasis on accelerators. We show a domain specific language (DSL) for dynamical cores on regular and irregular grids, that can be used to retain a single performance portable source code. The DSL allows the implementation of grid independent numerical operators using an unstructured grid syntax, abstracting the details of the underlying grid and the architecture dependent implementation.

LFRic and PSyclone: A Domain Specific Language Approach to Atmospheric Models for Exascale
Presenter:
Christopher Maynard (Met Office, United Kingdom)
+ Abstract
The large degree of parallelism and lack of common programming models between different processor architectures is forcing many scientific applications to re-write their codes. The Met Office has already completed a project to design a new, scalable dynamical core for an atmospheric model. The LFRic project, named after Lewis Fry Richardson is building a software infrastructure for an atmospheric model with a Gung Ho dynamical core. An important component of the software is PSyClone, a python code generator. Code written according to the API rules can be parsed by PSyClone and a parallel middle layer generated. Moreover, it is able to target different programming models for different architectures. This allows a single source of science code.

Chemistry & Materials
The ability to computationally design, optimize, or understand the properties of energy relevant materials is fundamentally contingent on the existence of methods to accurately, efficiently and reliably simulate them. Quantum mechanics based approaches must necessarily serve as a foundational role, since only these approaches can describe matter in a truly first-principles (parameter-free) and therefore robust manner. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are ideal candidates for this since they robustly deliver highly accurate calculations of complex materials, and with increased computer power provide systematically improvable accuracies that are not possible with other first principles methods. By directly solving the Schrödinger equation and by treating the electrons at a consistent many-body level, these methods can be applied to general elements and materials, and are unique in satisfying robust variational principles. More accurate solutions result in lower variational energies, enabling robust confidence intervals to be assigned to predictions. The stochastic nature of QMC facilitates mapping onto high-performance computing architectures. QMC is one of the few computational materials methods capable of fully exploiting today’s petaflop machines. This symposium will present some of the latest developments on QMC methods, from an application and a development perspective.

Stochastic Multi-Reference Perturbation Theory
Presenter:
Michel Caffarel (CNRS, France)
+ Abstract
I present an hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach for computing the second-orderperturbative contribution E(2) of multireference perturbation theories (MRPT). A formulaexpressing E(2) as a sum of contributions associated with each determinant of the MR wavefunction is derived and a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm to compute E(2) is presented. To greatlyenhance the MC convergence, a hybrid scheme based on the decomposition of E(2) into astochastic and a deterministic part is introduced. In sharp contrast to purely MC schemes, thehybrid estimator converges with a typical exponential-like behavior. The method is illustrated on the F2 and Cr2 molecules. Even for the largest case corresponding to the Cr2 molecule treated with the cc-pVQZ basis set, very accurate results are obtained for E(2) for an active space of (28e,198o) (Hilbert space including more than 10^42 determinants) and a MR wave function including up to 2.8x10^7 determinants.

High-Performance Computing of Accurate Electronic Structures from Model Space Quantum Monte Carlo
Presenter:
Seiichiro Ten-no (Kobe University, Japan)
+ Abstract
The model space quantum Monte Carlo (MSQMC) method [1] is capable of treating degenerate and quasi-degenerate electronic states with bond dissociations and electronic excitations avoiding a significant amount of the negative sign problem. The effective Hamiltonian is stochastically sampled by a walker representation of the transfer matrix. We present a massively parallel implementation of MSQMC and illustrative examples [2]. We will further derive MSQMC with the dual partitioning (DP) to obtain M solutions in the model space simultaneously avoiding intruder states [3], and F12 extensions. References: [1] S. Ten-no, J.

Preparing Quantum Monte Carlo for the Exascale
Presenter:
Luke Shulenburger (Sandia National Laboratories, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Quantum Monte Carlo is one of the most accurate and most computationally expensive methods for solving the electronic structure problem. In spite of its significant computational expense, its massively parallel nature is ideally suited to petascale computers which have enabled a wide range of applications to relatively large molecular and extended systems. Exascale capabilities have the potential to enable the application of QMC to significantly larger systems, capturing much of the complexity of real materials such as defects and impurities. However, both memory and computational demands will require significant changes to current algorithms to realize this possibility. This talk will detail both the causes of the problem and potential solutions. * Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

New Algorithms in QMCPACK; Science Applications in the Path to Exascale
Presenter:
Anouar Benali (Argonne National Laboratory, United States of America)
+ Abstract
With the advances in algorithms and growing computing powers, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have become a leading contender for high accuracy calculations for the electronic structure of realistic systems. It is general and applicable to a wide range of physical and chemical systems in any dimension, boundary conditions etc. The favorable scaling of O(N3) for an N-electron system and ample opportunities for parallelization make QMC methods uniquely powerful tools to study the electronic structure of realistic systems on large-scale parallel computers. This scalability has enabled calculations on a wide variety of systems, including large molecules, layered materials, transition metal oxides and general bulk properties of solids. In this talk, I will present the recent algorithmic developments implemented in the QMCPACK simulation code allowing it to run at scale on Leadership Class Supercomputer and a sample of applications enabled through these developments.

Emerging Domains in HPC
Human fertility is based on physiological events like adequate follicle maturation, ovulation, ovum fertilization, corpus luteum formation as well as endometrial implantation, proceeding in a chronological order. Diseases such as endometriosis or the polycystic ovary syndrome seriously disturb menstrual cycle patterns, oocyte maturation and consequently fertility. Besides endocrine diseases, several environmental and lifestyle factors, especially smoking and obesity, also have a negative impact on fertility. Modern techniques in reproductive medicine like in-vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection have increased the chances for successful reproduction. However, current success rates vary significantly among clinics, still reaching only about 35% even in well-functioning centers. This is mainly due to the usage of different treatment protocols and limited knowledge about individual variability in the dynamics of reproductive processes. This minisymposium brings together researchers with different scientific backgrounds (computer science, mathematics, medicine) who work on developing model-based clinical decision support systems for reproductive endocrinologists enabling the simulation and optimization of treatment strategies in-silico. Virtual physiological human (VPH) models together with patient specific parameterizations (Virtual Patients), formalized treatment strategies (Virtual Doctors) and software tools (Virtual Hospital) enable in silico clinical trials, that is clinical trials performed by means of computer simulations over a population of virtual patients. In silico clinical trials are recognized as a disruptive key innovation for medicine, as they allow medical scientists to reduce and postpone invasive, risky, costly and time-consuming in vivo experiments of new treatments to much later stages of the testing process, when a deeper knowledge of their effectiveness and side-effects has been acquired via simulations. The talks in the minisymposium will highlight different aspects of a virtual hospital in reproductive medicine. - Distributed service oriented systems for clinical decision support - HPC within in silico clinical trials - Construction of large virtual patient populations - Formalization of treatment strategies in silico - VPH model validation, treatment verification and the design of individualized protocols - Databases and software for the virtual hospital - Large scale integrated physiology models

HPC within In Silico Clinical Trials: PAEON experience
Presenter:
Enrico Tronci (Sapienza University, Italy)
+ Abstract
In Silico Clinical Trials (ISCT) require checking that for all "virtual patients" (i.e., biologically meaningful parameters for human physiology models) the treatment being assessed meets given safety and efficacy constraints. This entails two main steps: first, generating the population of virtual patients and, second, for each virtual patient running simulations in order to check the given safety and efficacy requirements. Both above ISCT steps are computationally very intensive and thus can considerably benefit from the usage of HPC tools. Resting on PAEON project experience, in this talk we will outline HPC based methods and software tools to support both automatic generation of virtual patients and treatment assessment for each virtual patient.

Meeting the requirements of clinical workflows renders the integration of such systems a daunting or even impossible task. Capturing clinical workflows and creating supporting data models often requires tailored solutions that impede data integration and interoperability. Here we report on our design approach based on clinical requirements and on the benefits and risks of developing and implementing a tailor made CDS System that is relevant for the health IT developer community.

A Clinical Decision Support System for Hormonal Treatments in Reproductive Endocrinology
Presenter:
Rainald Ehrig (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany)
+ Abstract
Virtual physiological human (VPH) models and software tools enable in silico clinical trials by means of computer simulations over a population of virtual patients. The focus here is on the construction of VPH models for reproductive endocrinology. They are based on a mathematical model that describes the time evolution of hormones and follicles during the human menstrual cycle. The model has been tuned and validated exploiting large amounts of retrospective clinical data to ensure that it reliably mimics the natural behaviour, both with and without administration of fertility drugs. The VPH model contains many parameters. Different values to these parameters yield different model behaviours and capture the physiological differences among different women. The construction of such virtual patient populations by means of, e.g., statistical model checking or empirical Bayes methods, requires significant computational effort.

Integrated Physiology in Modelica: HumMod and Physiomodel
Presenter:
Jiří Kofránek (Charles University, Czech Republic)
+ Abstract
Sophisticated medical training simulators must include models of various physiological subsystems, and also integrate them into a comprehensive whole. One of the largest models of integrated physiological systems called HumMod (http://hummod.org) is implemented as open source by thousands of XML files. Our reimplementation and extension of HumMod 1.6 in the Modelica language called PHYSIOMODEL (http://physiomodel.org), has brought a much clearer and more understandable description of the simulated complex physiological relationships than XML implementation. Modelica is well suited to exactly formalize integrative physiology. Modelica is an equation-based, and object-oriented language for hybrid ordinary differential equations. Almost every physiological term can be defined as a class in this language and can be instantiated as many times as it occurs in the body. Each class has a graphical icon for use in diagrams. These diagrams are self-describing; the Modelica code generated from them is the full representation of the underlying mathematical model.

A low-order implicit unstructured finite-element solver for Earth'scrust deformation problem is proposed. The solver scales up to294,912 CPU cores of K computer with 94.8% size-up efficiency,enabling solving a 504 billion degrees-of-freedom crust deformationproblem with 126 billion second-order tetrahedral elementsin 146.5 s at 0.970 PFLOPS (20.6% of peak) on 294,912 CPU cores.This is 11.1 times faster than a highly-tuned preconditioned conjugategradient solver and 2.18 times faster than the state-of-the-artSC14 Gordon Bell Prize Finalist solver. With the proposed solver, wesolved a practical 381 billion degrees-of-freedom Eastern Japan crustdeformation problem (576 km x 800 km x 400 km area; resolutionof 62.5 m) in 252.2 s using 294,912 CPU cores. Such high-resolutionanalysis assures the convergence of stress and strain required toevaluate nonlinear material constitutive models at plate boundariesand is expected to become a key tool for physics-based earthquakeforecasting.

We present a patch-based approach for tsunami simulation with paralleladaptive mesh refinement on the Salomon supercomputer. Thespecial architecture of Salomon, with two Intel Xeon CPUs (Haswellarchitecture) and two Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner)per compute node, suggests truly heterogeneous load balancinginstead of offload approaches, because host and accelerator achievecomparable performance for our simulations.We use a tree-structured mesh refinement strategy resultingfrom newest-vertex bisection of triangular grid cells, but introducesmall uniform grid patches into the leaves of the tree to allow vectorisationof the Finite Volume solver over grid cells. In particular,we implemented vectorised versions of the approximate Riemannsolvers, exploiting Fortran's array notations where possible. Whilelarge patches increase computational performance due to vectorisation,improved memory access and reduced meshing overhead,they also increase the overall number of processed cells. Thus, atrade-off must be found regarding the patch size. We experimentedwith different patch sizes in a study of the time-to-solution of asimulation of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, and found that relativelysmall patches with 82 cells resulted in the smallest execution times.We use the Xeon Phis in symmetric mode and apply heterogeneousload balancing between hosts and coprocessors, identifyingthe relative load distribution either from on-the-fly runtime measurementsor from a priori exhaustive testing. Both approachesperform better than homogeneous load balancing and better thanusing only the CPUs or only the Xeon Phi coprocessors in nativemode. In all set-ups, however, the absolute speedups are impededby the slow MPI communication between Xeon Phi coprocessors.

Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and Climate simulations sitin the intersection between classically understood High PerformanceComputing (HPC) and the Big Data / High PerformanceData Analytics (HPDA) communities. Driven by ever more ambitiousscientific goals, both the size and number of output dataelements generated as part of NWP operations has grown by severalorders of magnitude, and will continue to grow into the future.The total amount of data is expected to grow exponentially withtime, and over the last 30 years this increase has been approximately40% per year. This poses significant scalability challengesfor the data processing pipeline, and the movement of data throughand between stages is one of the most significant factors in this.

Chemistry & Materials
Interfaces (solid-solid, solid-liquid, solid-gas as well as liquid-gas) give a variety of interesting and crucial functions in condensed-matter physics and chemistry. The space-charge layer plays an important role in semiconductor physics, leading to several fundamentals of electronic devices. On the other hand, the electrochemistry always takes into account the electric double layer, crucial for catalysis, solar cell and battery applications. These modulations of charge-carrier distributions can expand up to micrometer scale, though nanometer-scale modulation happens as well in several cases. Therefore, sole first-principles electronic structure calculation does not work well. For these issues, special techniques to deal with the interface are necessary, on top of the large-scale and long-time QM-based simulations. QM/MM techniques or combinations of QM and continuum or classical theories can be potential solutions. This minisymposium brings together cutting-edge researchers working on these issues to discuss and evaluate individual methods and suggest future directions. This is important since relationships among the methods for the interfaces are difficult to see. Besides, the material-science flavor of this minisymposium provides perspectives addressing computer scientists and applied mathematicians, which will encourage future developments of interdisciplinary techniques.

Searching Stable Interface Structures with Bayesian Optimization
Presenter:
Koji Tsuda (University of Tokyo, Japan)
+ Abstract
Crystalline interfaces have a tremendous impact on the properties of materials. Determination of the atomic structure of the interface is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the interface properties. Despite this importance, extensive calculation is necessary to determine even one interface structure. In this study, we apply a machine learning technique called Bayesian optimization to accelerate the determination of the interface structure. The atomic structures of simplified coincidence-site lattice interfaces were determined using the optimization approach. Our method successfully determined the most stable interface structure with an efficiency almost 2 orders of magnitude better than the traditional “brute force” approach.

Combining Ab Initio Calculations with Electrostatic Models to Describe Defects at Surfaces at Realistic Temperature, Pressure, and Doping Conditions
Presenter:
Sergey V. Levchenko (Fritz Haber Institute Berlin, Germany)
+ Abstract
An important parameter influencing defect concentration and defect charge states is doping. Using ab-initio atomistic thermodynamics, we show [1] that (and how) charge-carrier doping influences significantly the transition levels and formation energies of defects at interfaces. In our approach, the energy density of the electric field is considered as part of the free energy of the system. Charged defects at surfaces are modelled using a variant of the virtual crystal approximation. Two main contributions to the defect formation energy are identified: (i) the interaction of a charged defect with the compensating charge and (ii) the shift in the Fermi level due to the space-charge formation. Our results for doped MgO show that the effects of charge-carrier doping on interface chemical properties can be significant, so that doping (intentional or not) must be considered as a thermodynamic variable along with temperature and pressure.

First-Principles Simulation of Electrochemical Reactions at Solid-Liquid Interface
Presenter:
Minoru Otani (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan)
+ Abstract
It is known that the chemical reaction at the solid-liquid interface to which a voltage is applied, that is to say, the electrochemical interface, has a significant influence on the durability and performance of the secondary battery and the fuel cell. For example, in a secondary battery, the electrode-electrolyte interface determines the durability of the battery, and in a fuel cell, the catalytic activity at the interface determines its performance. We are conducting research aiming at improving the performance of those electrochemical devices and presenting design guidelines by clarifying the microscopic process of chemical reaction at the electrochemical interface using first principles simulation. In this talk, I will introduce the simulation technique developed by us and present recent simulation results for the cyclic voltammogram of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction. I will also present more recent progress of simulation techniques for the solid-liquid interface.

Challenges in Electronic Structure Modeling of Battery Interfaces
Presenter:
Kevin Leung (Sandia National Laboratories, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Structure-function relationships at interfaces are critical for electrochemical applications. Atomic lengthscale details of buried liquid-solid and solid-solid interfaces are challenging to image. Tremendous progress has been made in DFT modeling of electrochemical interfaces, and the predictions provide crucial guiding insights. I will discuss some remaining challenges particular to modeling lithium ion battery interfaces, using published works by my group and others as illustrations. The challenges include: the inherently "dirty" (solid-film-covered) nature of electrodes, and parasitic/degradation reactions responsible for these films; the lack of Grand Canonical sampling of lithium content; and the difficulty in calibrating applied potentials, especially for small-polaron-conductor electrode materials. Modeling of solid-state-electrolyte- and liquid-based batteries will be discussed in a unified framework.

Physics
With a mass larger than that of the Sun compressed into an almost perfect sphere with a radius of only a dozen kilometers, neutron stars are the most compact material astrophysical objects we know. In their cores, particles are squeezed together more tightly than in atomic nuclei and no terrestrial experiment can reproduce the extreme physical conditions of density, temperature, and gravity. With such properties, it is clear that neutron stars in binary systems are unique laboratories to explore fundamental physics – such as the state of matter at nuclear densities – and fundamental astrophysics – such as the one behind the “central engine” in short gamma-ray bursts. Yet, such an exploration does not come easy. The nonlinear dynamics of binary neutron stars, which requires the combined solution of the Einstein equations together with those of relativistic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, and the complex microphysics that accompanies the inspiral and merger, make sophisticated numerical simulations in three dimensions the only route for an accurate modeling. This minisymposium will focus on the gravitational-wave emission during the inspiral and the connection between merging binaries and the corresponding electromagnetic counterpart. These two problems require urgent attention as they are both likely to play an important role in the imminent detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars by interferometric detectors such as LIGO and Virgo.

Simulating Generic Binary Neutron Star Mergers
Presenter:
Tim Dietrich (Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, Germany)
+ Abstract
Binary neutron star mergers are associated with a variety of observable phenomena in the gravitational and electromagnetic spectra. We investigate binary neutron stars in the last milliseconds before and after their merger with full 3D numerical simulations. We explain how we access previously inaccessible regions of the binary neutron star parameter space, e.g. spinning and high mass ratio setups, and we discuss first simulations with generic setups. We also show that recent upgrades allow us to improve the accuracy of the simulation and decrease the phase error of the obtained gravitational waveforms. With these updates our waveforms can be used for validating and improving semi-analytical waveform models.

Entropy-Limited Hydrodynamics: A Novel Approach to Relativistic Hydrodynamics
Presenter:
Federico Guercilena (Goethe University, Germany)
+ Abstract
We present entropy-limited hydrodynamics: a new approach for the computation of fluxes arising in the discretization of equations in conservation form. ELH is based on the hybridisation of a high-order scheme with the Lax-Friedrichs method. The activation of the low-order part of the scheme is driven by the generated entropy inspired by the artificial-viscosity method proposed by Guermond et al. We present ELH in the context of finite-differencing methods and of general-relativistic hydrodynamics. We study the performance of ELH in a series of astrophysical tests in general relativity. We present a comparison of ELH with the MP5 method, one of the most common schemes. We find that ELH achieves comparable or better accuracy than more traditional methods at a fraction of the computational cost. Given its accuracy and its simplicity of implementation, ELH is a promising framework for the development of relativistic hydrodynamics codes well adapted for parallel supercomputers.

+ Abstract
Mergers of neutron star binaries are exquisite multi-physics laboratories: they are strong sources of gravitational waves, they are the best models for the central trigger of short gamma-ray bursts, they emit enormous amounts of neutrinos and they are the likely sources of the heaviest elements in the Universe. In this talk, we will review the channels through which neutron star mergers expel matter and we discuss the related nucleosynthesis. We further discuss the electromagnetic emission that is expected to follow the gravitational wave chirp.

Numerical Simulations of the Magnetic Field Amplification in Neutron Stars
Presenter:
Pablo Cerda-Duran (University of Valencia, Spain)
+ Abstract
Strong magnetic fields (>10^15 G) are expected to be present in some class of neutron stars (magnetars) and may play an important role in the binary neutron star (BNS) model of short GRBs. However, it is still not clear how a large-scale magnetic field of such strength could be generated. I present numerical simulations of the amplification of magnetic fields in two different contexts: in the case of proto-neutron stars I present results of local simulations of the magneto-rotational instability and I discuss their implications in this context. In the case of BNS, I present high resolution GRMHD simulations of the merger of two neutron stars in which the magnetic field is amplified driven by the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. The resulting magnetic field is highly turbulent and may meet the conditions to develop a dynamo, which could generate large-scale ordered field in longer time-scales.

The computation of bulks of inner eigenpairs of large sparse matrices is known to be both an algorithmic challenge and resource intensive in terms of compute power. As the compute capabilities have continuously increased over the past decades, computational models or applications requiring information about inner eigenstates of sparse matrices have become numerically accessible in many research fields. At the same time new algorithms (e.g. FEAST or SSM) have been introduced and long-standing methods such as filter diagonalization are still being applied, improved and extended. However, the trend towards highly parallel (heterogeneous) compute systems is challenging the efficiency of existing solver packages as well as building block libraries and calls for new massively parallel solvers with high hardware efficiency across different architectures. Thus, substantial effort is put into the implementation of new sparse (eigen)solver frameworks which face challenges both in terms easy to use, extendibility, sustainability, and hardware efficiency. Software engineering and holistic performance engineering concepts are deployed to address these challenges. The significant momentum in the application fields, numerical methods, and software layers calls for a strong interaction between scientists involved in those activities to provide sustainable and hardware efficient frameworks to compute inner eigenvalues of large sparse matrices. The minisymposium offers a platform to bring together leading experts in this field to discuss recent developments at all levels: from the application down to hardware efficient implementations of basic kernel operations. Application experts will present their current and upcoming research fields requiring the computation of inner eigenvalues. State-of-the-art eigensolvers and new algorithmic developments will be discussed along with challenges faced by library developers in terms of software sustainability and hardware efficiency. Many of these topics are not limited to the inner sparse eigenvalue problems but are of general interest for sparse linear algebra algorithms for current and future HPC architectures. Part 2 of the minisymposium focuses on algorithms as well as software and performance aspects.

Parallel Preconditioned Iterative Solvers on Manycore Architectures
Presenter:
Kengo Nakajima (The University of Tokyo, Japan)
+ Abstract
In this work, optimization and performance evaluation of ICCG solver (conjugate gradient iterative method (CG) preconditioned by incomplete Cholesky factorization (IC)) on manycore architectures are investigated, where ICCG solver solves sparse symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices derived from Poisson’s equation discretized by finite-volume method (FVM). Because ICCG includes operations with data-dependency, such as forward/backward substitutions, and incomplete Cholesky factorization, extraction of parallelism by reordering based on CM-RCM (Cyclic Multicoloring on Reverse Cuthill-Mckee) has been applied. Effects of reordering and format for matrix storage (CRS, SELL, SELL-C-Sigma) are considered. The performance was evaluated on a single socket/node of each of Intel Xeon/Phi (Knights Corner, Knights Landing), Intel Xeon (Broadwell-EP), and NVIDIA Tesla P100 (Pascal). Performance of the ICCG with SELL-C-Sigma on Knights Landing was better than existing methods.

Batched Factorization and Inversion Routines for Block-Jacobi Preconditioning on GPUs
Presenter:
Hartwig Anzt (University of Tennessee, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Block-Jacobi preconditioners play an important role in scientific computing. Particularly for FEM discretizations that inherently carry some block structure, block-diagonal scaling can provide significant convergence improvement. At the same time, scaling with independent diagonal blocks allows for efficient parallelization. This property makes block-Jacobi especially attractive for parallel hardware. From the algorithmic side, block-Jacobi preconditioning can be realized by explicitly inverting the diagonal blocks in the preconditioner setup and apply the scaling in terms of multiplications, or by factorizing the diagonal blocks and realizing the preconditioner application as triangular solves.

Software and Performance Engineering for Iterative Eigensolvers
Presenter:
Jonas Thies (German Aerospace Center, Germany)
+ Abstract
The complexity of the latest HPC architectures increasingly limits the productivity of researchers in numerical algorithms and the ‘time to market' for parallel algorithms. Implementing a new method on a supercomputer today involves at least three levels of parallelism and typically several programming models like MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. Frameworks like Trilinos and PETSc have for many years been useful for testing new ideas in parallel algorithms. But when it comes to e.g. CPU/GPU clusters they fail to deliver convincing performance to date. We look at sparse solvers from a software engineer's point of view and advocate a programming model we call ‘SPMD+OK', introducing performance models in the test-driven development process and a strategy to facilitate the integration of algorithmic developments into existing applications. Harnessing the peta-scale with the block Jacobi-Davidson method is used as a running example in this talk, and the libraries GHOST and PHIST are presented (https://bitbucket.org/essex/).

An Overview of the Trilinos Project Exascale Strategy: From Algorithms to Software Products
Presenter:
Michael A. Heroux (Sandia National Laboratories, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Preparing for Exascale computer systems requires fundamental changes in algorithms, software design, and implementation. While effective use of on-node concurrency has been essential for some years, new algorithm classes are still emerging, and the design and implementation of reusable software libraries for these new platforms is still unsettled. In this presentation, we describe the Exascale roadmap for the Trilinos project, a collection of reusable scientific software libraries for constructing, managing and solving large scientific computing problems on parallel systems. We discuss our efforts to expose and utilize new concurrency resources through changes in algorithms, design choices and implementation strategies for reusable libraries, as application codes move to expose greater concurrency and asynchronous execution.

Domain-Decomposition-Based Fluid Structure Interaction Methods using Nonlinear Anisotropic Arterial Wall Models
Presenter:
Alexander Heinlein (University of Cologne, Germany)
+ Abstract
Stress distributions in walls of in vivo arteries (transmural stresses) are a major factor driving, e.g., arteriosclerosis and arteriogenesis. We focus on fluid-structure interaction (FSI) using sophisticated nonlinear structural models, which have already been developed and adapted to experiments in the past. In particular, we use an anisotropic, polyconvex hyperelastic structural model for FSI simulations in an idealized benchmark geometry and in realistic patient-specific geometries of coronary arteries. The coupled FSI problems are solved using a monolithic approach based on domain decomposition, i.e., overlapping Schwarz and Dirichlet-Neumann methods. Our solver environment combines the FEM software packages LifeV and FEAP, which provide the nonlinear models for the fluid and a nonlinear, polyconvex, anisotropic model for the structure. Furthermore, we discuss improvements in the computing time of our FSI simulations, e.g., due to the use of suitable parallel domain decomposition preconditioners.

A Multiphysics Approach for Early Atherosclerosis Progression
Presenter:
Moritz Thon (TU Munich, Germany)
+ Abstract
We present a framework for a coupled multiphysics approach for early atherosclerosis progression. It consists of a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) subproblem describing the cardiovascular mechanics, which is coupled to a multiple species subproblem describing the inflammatory processes in early atherosclerosis. In this context, the challenge is the coupling of an incompressible flow with a deformable structure undergoing large deformations, where in the two scalar subproblems the shear stress dependent migration of key species from the fluid into the structure is of special interest. Migrated species react and constitute mechanobiological remodeling, change of material behavior and finally the development of a stenosis. We present a sequentially staggered solution method coupling a monolithic FSI with a monolithic species subproblem. A convergence analysis of the computational model as well as specific high performance computing aspects are addressed. Examples are given demonstrating the benefits of a multiphysics approach for modeling atherosclerosis progression.

An Integrated Electro-Mechano-Fluid Model for Cardiac Simulations
Presenter:
Antonello Gerbi (EPFL, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
We propose an integrated cardiac model coupling the electrophysiology, the mechanics, and the fluid dynamics of the left ventricle of a human heart. Our model combines the monodomain equation for the electric activity of the tissue, an orthotropic model for the mechanical description of the muscle in both its active and passive components, and the Navier-Stokes equations in a deforming geometry representing the left ventricle chamber. We consider a spatial approximation of the differential model based on the Finite Element method and Backward Differentiation Formulas for the time discretization. We focus on the approximation of the integrated model by means of a monolithic strategy for which we exploit preconditioning strategies based on block factorization. We perform numerical simulations in a high performance computing framework with both idealized and patient-specific geometries, the latter obtained from medical MRI images.

Scalable Domain Decomposition Solvers for Cardiac Electro-Mechanical Dynamics
Presenter:
Luca F. Pavarino (University of Pavia, Italy)
+ Abstract
This talk focuses on scalable domain decomposition preconditioners for cardiac electro-mechanical dynamics. The coupled 3D models considered consist of 1) the quasi-static transversely isotropic finite elasticity equations for the deformation of the cardiac tissue; 2) the active tension model for the intracellular calcium dynamics and cross-bridge binding; 3) the anisotropic Bidomain model for the electrical current flow through the deforming cardiac tissue; 4) the membrane model of ventricular myocytes, including stretch-activated channels. The proposed finite element parallel solver employs Multilevel Additive Schwarz preconditioners for the solution of the discretized Bidomain equations and Newton-Krylov methods with AMG or BDDC preconditioners for the solution of the discretized nonlinear finite elasticity equations. The results of several parallel simulations show the scalability of both linear and nonlinear solvers and their application to the study of both normal and turbulent cardiac dynamics with re-entrant scroll waves, including different mechanisms of mechano-electrical feedbacks.

Kinetic simulations play an essential role towards understanding the dynamics of plasmas in the fields of nuclear fusion, laser plasma interaction, and astrophysics. The complexity of kinetic computations, in particular, their high dimensionality and multi-scale nature, lead to exciting challenges in physics, applied mathematics, and computer science. For example, modeling the plasma dynamics close to the edge of magnetic fusion devices requires codes which can flexibly handle complex geometries and implement enhanced gyrokinetic models or fully kinetic descriptions. Modern numerical tools such as multi-scale methods, structure-preserving schemes, and isogeometric meshes, therefore, need to be adapted to plasma physics models in order to enhance state-of-the-art kinetic codes. At the same time, new programming models are necessary to prepare codes for the use on emerging heterogeneous HPC systems. This includes vectorization, cache efficient memory organization, task-based parallelism as well as new algorithms that are adapted to modern hardware. This minisymposium shall bring together scientists from physics, applied mathematics, and computer science to discuss current trends in the development of (gyro) kinetic codes.

Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Simulations with GENE and the Sparse Grid Combination Technique
Presenter:
Mario Heene (University of Stuttgart, Germany)
+ Abstract
Two of the main challenges of future exascale HPC systems are scalability and fault tolerance. To ensure scalability on such extreme scales, new numerical algorithms are required that reduce the need for global communication and synchronization and thus the amount of data that has to be communicated. To cope with predicted failure rates, the algorithms furthermore have to be able to cope with hard and silent faults. Algorithm-based fault tolerance is required instead of checkpoint-restart. For the solution of higher-dimensional PDEs such as they arise in plasma physics, hierarchical numeric methods come to the rescue. We present algorithms for the solution of high-dimensional PDEs for sparse grids which we study for gyrokinetic simulations with GENE. They exploit a hierarchical extrapolation scheme, the sparse grid combination technique. Our approach uses an extra coarse-grained level of parallelism for scalability and a new numerical fault-tolerant scheme.

Two-Species Semi-Lagrangian Simulations for Solving the Vlasov-Poisson System in 2d2v
Presenter:
Yann Barsamian (University of Strasbourg, France)
+ Abstract
The goal of the present work is to achieve high performance in a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallel semi-Lagrangian code. The domain of application is plasma physics: the semi-Lagrangian code simulates two-species 2d2v Vlasov-Poisson systems on cartesian grids with periodic boundary conditions. We investigate and compare two parallel approaches: one in which, for each time step, we have to transpose the parallel representation of the distribution functions among MPI processes, and one in which we perform domain decomposition. Memory and communication issues are discussed, and scalability results are shown. The code is written in C, with OpenMP pragmas, suitable for Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Many Integrated Cores (MIC) architectures. One application in mind is to run simulations on the Intel Knights Landing (KNL) nodes of the Marconi supercomputer. Extensions to Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architectures are envisaged with OpenACC directives.

Hybrid OpenMP/MPI Parallelization of the Charge Deposition Step in the Global Gyrokinetic Particle-In-Cell Code ORB5
Presenter:
Emmanuel Lanti (EPFL, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Gyrokinetic simulations are computationally extremely demanding due to the high dimensionality of the physical phase space and the interplay between plasma particles and electromagnetic fields. It is thus essential to make full use of the available numerical resources to be able to simulate more complex physical problems. With the aim of optimizing the gyrokinetic Particle-In-Cell code ORB5 towards exascale computing, a particle sorting method is implemented to increase data locality. Furthermore, different algorithms are used to improve vectorization, and the MPI parallelization is complemented with OpenMP. More specifically, we shall focus on the particle to grid operations involved in the PIC charge deposition step. The latter is critical to parallelize using a shared memory paradigm due to the scatter operations involved. We will present the different algorithms and parallelization schemes implemented in the ORB5 charge deposition step and how they affect the speedup compared to the base MPI case.

Prediction of the Node to Node Communication Costs of a New Gyrokinetic Code with Toroidal Domain
Presenter:
Andreas Jocksch (ETH Zurich / CSCS, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Gyrokinetic codes running at large scale play a central role in plasma physics. We apply virtual decompositions of the toroidal domain in three dimensions in addition to domain cloning to existing simulations done with the Orb5 code. We determine the communication volume and the number of communication partners per timestep for every virtual subdomain (node) for the particles and the structured mesh. Thus the scaling properties of a code with the new domain decompositions and unchanged Orb5 numerics are derived for simple models of the computer network and processing units. For a typical simulation with 256 million particles and a mesh of 256x512x256 grid points scaling to the entire Piz Daint should be achieved with the new domain decompositions suggested. The knowledge obtained can be used for the design of new gyrokinetic codes and the design of new supercomputers.

Kinetics of Multivalent Bindings
Presenter:
Franziska Erlekam (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany)
+ Abstract
In medical drug design multivalent bindings of ligands and receptors is a critical biological process, i.e. inflamed tissue or viruses are receptors; and molecular drugs such as peptides act as ligands that bond with these receptors. Simultaneous or sequential binding of relatively weak binding partners increase the overall binding affinity. Therefore modern drug design tries to synthesize artificial multivalent bindings in order to increase the binding affinity of the drug to the virus. This talk aims at giving insights into the transition networks of ligand-receptor interactions and their effect on kinetics. Monovalent and also bivalent binding processes have been studied more or less extensively, but quantitative models for n-valent bindings are still missing. To bridge this gap a PDE approach for the binding and rebinding processes is used. The diffusion process is modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation. These modeled binding dynamics are compared with experimental data from organic chemistry.

Generalized Perron Cluster Analysis for Non-Equilibrium Steady State Systems
Presenter:
Franziska Erlekam (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany)
+ Abstract
In a Markov State Model (MSM) an underlying stochastic process is described by a (small) transition matrix between clustered states. Under the assumption that this stochastic process has a metastable character, i.e., the system stays mostly in a metastable set of states and switches only rarely between these sets, the stochastic process is described by a low dimensional basis. In this sense, an MSM is a coarse graining method. In many MSM it is assumed that the underlying process is reversible, i.e., the process meets the detailed balance condition. When considering Non-Equilibrium Steady States, the underlying Markov chain is no longer reversible and thus the eigenvalue structure, being crucial for MSM, can no longer be employed. To overcome this we present a novel MSM method (GenPCCA), which finds a low dimensional description of even nonreversible Markov processes by using a Schur decomposition instead. Applications of the method are shown.

Markov State Models with Reweighting
Presenter:
Luca Donati (Freie Universität Berlin, Germany)
+ Abstract
Molecular Dynamics simulations are characterized by metastable states and transitions that occur at different timescales. Recent studies have proven, through Markov State Models analysis, that the timescales strongly depend on the potential energy of the molecule. Even small perturbations produce large scale effects on the dynamics of the system. The potential energy perturbation has effects on the probability measure of the system. We exploit the Girsanov theorem to predict the change of measure. This leads to redefining the time correlation function under the new probability measure and to construct the MSM of the system under perturbation. The method can be used to predict the timescales of a molecular system without rerunning molecular dynamics simulations when an external force is applied to the potential energy. In particular, it is relevant to force-field optimization. We present preliminary results for alanine dipeptide and a benchmark test that shows the efficiency of the method.

Applications of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization in Spectroscopy
Presenter:
Amir Niknejad (College of Mount Saint Vincent, United States of America)
+ Abstract
The main objective of the analysis of time-resolved Raman spectra is to reconstruct the spectral bands of the different compounds involved in the reaction as well as the process of relative concentrations of these compounds during the reaction process. A popular approach in chemoinformatics is to factor the data matrix into the product of two non-negative matrices, one representing spectral bands and the other relative concentrations of compounds.Given the data matrix, our first main treatment is to perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on data matrix. The left SVD-matrix U is supposed to represent the time-resolved relative concentrations of the compounds. But this matrix may not satisfy the properties of a concentration matrix (non-negativity and row sum one). Thus, we apply a spectral clustering algorithm (Inner Simplex) on U in order to overcome this obstacle. Finally, we present a nonlinear optimization framework in order to reconstruct the spectral bands matrix.

Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation for Dissipative Particle Dynamics
Presenter:
Lina Kulakova (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Large Data, advanced sampling methods and High Performance Computing are changing the landscape of Computational Life Sciences. We integrate these three components in a Bayesian uncertainty quantification and prediction framework. In this talk we show the application of this framework to blood flow models using Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). We calibrate the parameters of the DPD solvent using available data on hydrodynamic correlations. We also quantify uncertainties of the blood models using data on Red Blood Cell (RBC) stretching and its rotation frequency in the shear flow. A computational bottleneck for Bayesian inference is the cost of the DPD simulations. We implement a Neural Network surrogate model which is shown to predict the rotation frequency of a RBC in a shear flow given the model parameters. We compare the obtained DPD/RBC parameters with those used in literature and showcase results from simulations with quantified uncertainties.

We will present a new particle-based cell model and its application to simulations of cell passage through the microfluidic devices. We developed two software implementations of the model targeting multi-GPU and multi-CPU supercomputers. We studied experimentally and computationally three cell groups classified by cell size in three microfluidic devices and obtained good agreement between experimental data and model predictions. Further, we studied the impact of different cell components, such as nucleus and cytoskeleton on cell deformation.

Adaptive Resolution Simulations Coupling Atomistic to Supramolecular Water Models
Presenter:
Matej Praprotnik (National Institute of Chemistry, Slovenia)
+ Abstract
We present adaptive resolution molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous solvents using coarse-grained molecular models that are compatible with the MARTINI force field. The solvent molecules change their resolution between the atomistic and coarse-grained representations according to their positions in the system. The difficulties that arise from coupling to a coarse-grained model with a supramolecular mapping have been successfully circumvented by using bundled water models. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this multiscale approach on several examples, e.g., coupling of atomistic water with polarizable and non-polarizable MARTINI water models. Next, to overcome the limitations of the bundled water models we introduce a clustering algorithm SWINGER that can concurrently assemble, disassemble, and reassemble water bundles. It allows for a seamless coupling between standard atomistic and supramolecular water models in adaptive resolution simulations. SWINGER paves the way for efficient multiscale simulations of biomolecular systems without compromising the accuracy of atomistic water models.

A Hybrid Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics and Immersed Boundary Method (SDPD-IBM) for Simulation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) in Flows
Presenter:
Ting Ye (Jilin University, China)
+ Abstract
In biofluid flow systems, often the flow problems of fluids of complex structures, such as the flow of red blood cells (RBCs) through complex capillary vessels, need to be considered. The smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD), a particle-based method, is an easy and flexible method to model such complex structure fluids. The immersed boundary method (IBM), a preferred method for handling fluid-structure interaction problems, has also been widely used to handle the fluid-RBC interaction in RBC simulations. We aim to couple SDPD and IBM together to develop a novel model, namely SDPD-IBM, with the best features in SDPD and IBM. To examine the SDPD-IBM, we first perform the verification and validation for establishing its credibility, and then simulate a RBC in simple to complex tubes for demonstrating its capability (including the rectangular, cylinder, curved, bifurcate and constricted tubes, respectively).

This minisymposium lies at the interface of computer science and applied mathematics, presenting recent advances in methods, ideas and algorithms addressing resilience for extreme-scale computing.
Extreme scale systems are expected to exhibit more frequent system faults due to both hardware and software, making resilience a key problem to face. On the hardware side, challenges will arise due to the expected increase in the number of components, variable operational modes (e.g. lower voltage to address energy requirements), and increasing complexity (e.g. memory hierarchies, heterogeneous cores, more, smaller transistors). The software stack will need to keep up with the increasing hardware complexity, hence becoming itself more error-prone.
In general, we can distinguish between three main categories of faults, namely hard (where a hardware component fails and needs to be fixed/replaced), soft/transient (a fault occurs, but is corrected by the hardware or low-level system software), and silent/undetectable (an error occurs but cannot be detected and fixed). The first two categories have a well-defined impact on the run and the system itself. The third class is more subtle because its effect is simply to alter stored, transmitted, or processed information, and there is no opportunity for an application to directly recover from a fault. This can lead to noticeable impacts such as crashes and hangs, as well as corrupted results. Current systems do not have an integrated approach to fault tolerance, namely the various subsystems have their own mechanisms for error detection and recovery (e.g. ECC memory). Also, there is no good error isolation, e.g. the failure of any component in a parallel job generally causes the entire job to fail. In fact, the current standard of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) system does not support failing ranks. Common approaches for fault-tolerance include hardware-level redundancy, algorithmic error correction code and checkpoint/restart. The latter is currently the most widely used approach. However, the tight power budget targeted for future systems and the expected shortening of the mean-time-between-failures (MTBF) may cause it to become an unfeasible solution for extreme-scale computing.
It is increasingly more recognized that hardware-only resilience will likely become unfeasible in the long term. This sets the need to develop an integrated approach, where resilience is tackled across all layers to mitigate the impact of faults in a holistic fashion, keeping under consideration its interplay with the energy budget. Hence, in parallel to the continuous effort aimed at improving resilience for hardware and system software, new approaches/ideas need to be incorporated at the highest level, i.e. algorithms and applications, to account for potential faults, e.g. silent data corruptions (SDCs). In other words, algorithms themselves need to be made more robust and resilient. This minisymposium explores HPC resilience in the context of algorithms, applications, hardware, system and runtimes. Specifically, the talks have been selected to cover topics ranging, e.g., from solvers, programming models and energy-aware computing, to approximate computing, memory vulnerability and post-Moore’s.

Resilience in Extreme-Scale Iterative Linear Solvers
Presenter:
Wilfried Gansterer (University of Vienna, Austria)
+ Abstract
Node failures, as well as increased global communication latencies, are considered important challenges for extreme-scale computing. Long-running scientific simulations often spend a considerable fraction of their runtime on solving large sparse linear systems of equations. Common iterative algorithms for solving those large sparse linear systems are Krylov solvers like the conjugate gradient (CG) and the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) methods.Pipelined variants of GMRES and CG, which overlap global communication latencies with computation and non-global communication, have been proposed. Moreover, interpolation-restart schemes have been proposed for recovering from node failures in Krylov subspace methods. For improving both scalability and resilience of Krylov solvers we investigate combining these two ideas. We illustrate how resulting resilient pipelined CG and GMRES methods behave for different node failure distributions and interpolation-restart strategies. We investigate novel interpolation-restart schemes which strive to reduce communication and analyze the trade-off between resilience, communication cost, and convergence rate.

Scaling and Energy Analysis for a Resilient ULFM-Based PDE Solver
Presenter:
Francesco Rizzi (Sandia National Laboratories, United States of America)
+ Abstract
We present a resilient task-based domain-decomposition preconditioner for PDEs built on top of User-Level Fault Mitigation Message Passing Interface (ULFM-MPI). The algorithm reformulates the PDE as a sampling problem, followed by a robust regression-based solution update that is resilient to silent data corruptions (SDCs). We adopt a server-client model where all state information is held by the servers, while clients only serve as computational units. The task-based nature of the algorithm and ULFM complement each other to support missing tasks, making the application resilient to clients failing. We present scaling results on Edison (NERSC), for a nominal and a fault-injected case, showing that even in the presence of faults, scalability tested up to 50k cores is within 90%. We quantify the scaling variability due to the presence of faults. Finally, we discuss the performance with respect to subdomain size, server/client configuration, and the interplay between energy and resilience.

Dynamic and Low Overhead Analysis of Memory Vulnerability
Presenter:
Marc Casas (Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain)
+ Abstract
Memory reliability is measured as a fault rate, i.e. a probability over a given amount of time. The missing link to know the fault probability of any data stored in memory is its storage duration. By analyzing memory access patterns of an application, we can thus determine the vulnerability of data stored in memory, and thus the optimal amount of redundancy to keep fault probabilities below an acceptable threshold at all times. This allows to dynamically get fault probabilities for memory storage, and opens the door to runtime optimizations. The open problem remains the right set of actuators to use for a runtime system, in order to adapt the strength of memory protection. Some leads are to have different ECC strengths, either through an adaptable ECC scheme whose amount of redundancy can be adjusted or through different chips with the option of migrating data under different protection requirements.

Inexact Computing and the Interface with Resilience
Presenter:
Laura Monroe (Los Alamos National Laboratory, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Smaller feature size in the late-CMOS era is expected to increase the number of faults occurring in systems, and this trend is exacerbated by the larger number of parts needed to field exascale and larger systems. Inexact computing may be one way to address these problems. Inexact computing includes both probabilistic and approximate computing techniques. Probabilistic computation dates back to the 50s. The calculation is done non-deterministically and the result may be correct or “correct enough”. Approximate computation is deterministic, and produces results that are “close enough”, where the lack of precision may be due to word length limits or numerical methods. There is some overlap between the fields of resilience/reliability and inexact computing. In this talk, we discuss the commonalities between the fields.

Chair:
Jack Wells (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, United States of America)
The goal of the PASC papers program is to advance the quality of formal scientific communication between the relative disciplines of computational science and engineering. The program was built from an observation that the computer science community traditionally publishes in the proceedings of major, international conferences, while the domain science community generally publishes in discipline-specific journals – and cross readership is very limited. The aim of our initiative is to build and sustain a platform that enables engagement between the computer science, applied mathematics and domain science communities, through a combination of conference participation, conference papers and post-conference journal publications. The PASC papers initiative allows authors to benefit from the interdisciplinarity and rapid dissemination of results afforded by the conference venue, as well as from the impact associated with subsequent publication in a high-quality scientific journal. To help facilitate such journal publication, PASC has recently formed collaborative partnerships with a number of scientific journals, including Computer Physics Communications (CPC), the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES), and ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (ACM TOMS). In this panel discussion, representatives from these journals are invited to express their thoughts regarding publication practices in the computational sciences, including the publication of software codes. We will discuss best practices for sustainable software development and address questions such as: how can we ensure that code and infrastructure will still be there in ten-plus years? How can we validate published results and guarantee reproducibility? Finally, we will describe our vision for the PASC papers initiative going forward.

+ Abstract
+ Biography
The last decades have seen the steady and exhilarating development of powerful quantum simulation tools to describe matter at the microscopic scale. Since these simulations are performed without any experimental input or parameters, they can accelerate or replace actual physical experiments. This is a far-reaching paradigm shift, substituting the cost- and time-scales of brick-and-mortar facilities with those, very different, of computing engines. In fact, these days most countries are investing in "materials genome initiatives" aimed at accelerating the discovery of novel materials using quantum simulations, with a focus on solving our most pressing societal problems - from solar energy harvesting to transportation to information-and-communication technologies.The talk offers a perspective on the current state-of-the-art in the field, its power and limitations, and on the role and opportunities for novel models of doing computational science - leveraging big data or artificial intelligence - to conclude with some examples on how quantum simulations are accelerating our quest for novel materials and functionalities.

CHE-01 A Molecular Dynamics Study of the Thermodynamics of Attachment of Saccharides to Halloysite
Presenter:
Riccardo Innocenti Malini (Empa, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Chemistry & Materials
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Halloysites are a class of tubular alumino-silicates often integrated within polymeric matrices as mechanical reinforcement or/and as drug carriers. To maximize the strength of the final material and control drug delivery, it is important to evaluate the polymer-mineral interaction at the interface. Here, Molecular Dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the adsorption of different saccharides on the halloysite surface. By using Umbrella Sampling, we extract the change in free energy related to the attachment of protonated and unprotonated chitosan, chitin and alginate. These saccharides were chosen because of their different functionalities and their importance towards biotechnological applications. The results show that all saccharides can bind to the surface, even though alginate does so when additional cations are present in the solution. By running the free energies calculations at different temperatures, we extracted the enthalpy and entropy of reaction, thereby allowing us to understand the binding driving force.

CHE-02 DBCSR: A Sparse Matrix Multiplication Library for Electronic Structure Codes
Presenter:
Andreas Glöss (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Chemistry & Materials
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication is an essential building block for a wide range of algorithms in various scientific fields. For this task, the sparse matrix library DBCSR [1] has been developed. Its multi-layered structure automatically takes care of and optimizes several computational aspects like parallelism (MPI, OMP, GPU), data (cache) locality and on-the-fly filtering. We introduce a framework for sparse tensor linear algebra, which enables low-scaling electronic structure methods beyond density functional theory. This framework is based on DBCSR for mapping tensor contractions block-wise to matrix-matrix multiplications. We also report on optimizations and performance comparison of the MPI communications, based on 2.5D algorithm, and the backends, namelyLIBXSMM and CUDA. Furthermore, in order to facilitate usability, a suite of tools has been developed to auto-generate the full documentation of the library.

CHE-03 First-Principles Study on Interfaces between Sulfide Electrolyte and Oxide Cathode in All-Solid-State Battery
Presenter:
Yoshitaka Tateyama (National Institute for Materials Science, Japan)
Track(s):
Chemistry & Materials
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
All-solid-state Li-ion batteries have been regarded as promising next-generation batteries. However, large interfacial resistance for ion transport is usually observed even if promising sulfide electrolyte is set on typical oxide cathode. These phenomena have been explained with structural disorder and space-charge layer of Li ion around the interface, though little is known about the atomistic mechanism. Then, we investigated probable heterogeneous interfaces between a sulfide electrolyte (β-Li3PS4) and an oxide cathode (LiCoO2) by DFT+U calculations with some techniques to evaluate the stable matching of incommensurate solid-solid interface and the site-dependent chemical potential of Li ion. The results indicate that the Li depletion can proceed at the beginning of the charge process, corresponding to the space-charge layer scenario. Furthermore, we found that the Co and P mixing across the interface is preferred, while the Li-depletion tendency still exists. Therefore, the Li-depletion seems a major factor of the interfacial resistance.

CHE-04 Mapping and Classifying Molecules from a High-Throughput Structural Database
Presenter:
Felix Musil (EPFL, Switzerland)
Track(s):

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
High-throughput computational materials design promises to greatly accelerate the process of discovering new materials and compounds, and of optimizing their properties. The large databases of structures and properties that result from computational searches, as well as the agglomeration of data of heterogeneous provenance leads to considerable challenges when it comes to navigating the database, representing its structure at a glance, understanding structure–property relations, eliminating duplicates and identifying inconsistencies. Here we present a case study, based on a data set of conformers of amino acids and dipeptides, of how machine-learning techniques can help addressing these issues. We will exploit a recently-developed strategy to define a metric between structures, and use it as the basis of both clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques—showing how these can help reveal structure–property relations, identify outliers and inconsistent structures, and rationalize how perturbations (e.g. binding of ions to the molecule) affect the stability of different conformers.

CHE-05 Soft-Sphere Continuum Solvation in Electronic Structure Calculations
Presenter:
Giuseppe Fisicaro (University of Basel, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Chemistry & Materials
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
An implicit solvation approach is presented to handle solutes and surfaces in contact with dielectric environments and electrolytes in electronic-structure calculations. The interface between the quantum solute and the surrounding environment is described by a continuum and differentiable permittivity, built up with atomic-centered “soft” spheres. It smoothly connects the cavity inner part and the bulk solvent. The electrostatic problem is solved by means of a recently developed generalized Poisson solver based on Interpolating Scaling Functions, free of finite difference filters. The continuum permittivity allows to compute analytically the non-electrostatic contributions to the solvation free energy, function of the cavity volume and surface. The whole methodology is computationally robust and gives high accuracy and parallel efficiency, keeping computational efforts and runtime at vacuum level. Its calibration as well as several applications on reaction barriers and structure predictions in solution will be presented, which prove the powerful of such explicit/implicit treatment.

CHE-06 Solvent-Aware Interfaces in Continuum Solvation
Presenter:
Oliviero Andreussi (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Chemistry & Materials
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Continuum models of solvation are well-assessed tools in chemistry and are becoming increasingly important in simulations of materials. Key ingredient of any continuum model, affecting its accuracy and faithfulness, is the definition of the cavity, i.e. the interface between what is treated with full quantum-mechanical details (solute) and what is modeled as a continuum (environment). Different methodologies introduce sharp or smooth functions of the atomic or electronic degrees of freedom of the solute. Straightforward local formulations fail in correctly describing inaccessible regions of space, in which the solvent should not be present. Typical examples of these situations include empty pockets in molecular systems and hollow sites or channels in crystals. Here we present a non-local definition of the cavity to correct artifacts coming from inaccessible regions of space smaller than a predetermined solvent radius, allowing to maintain a continuously differentiable expression of the interface with a moderate computational overhead.

CLI-03 ESCAPE: Accelerating Extreme-Scale Numerical Weather Prediction
Presenter:
Willem Deconinck (ECMWF, United Kingdom)
Track(s):
Climate & Weather
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
The algorithms underlying numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models that have been developed in the past few decades face an increasing challenge caused by the paradigm shift imposed by hardware vendors towards more energy-efficient devices. In order to provide a sustainable path to exascale HPC, applications become increasingly restricted by energy consumption. As a result, the emerging diverse and complex hardware solutions have a large impact on the programming models traditionally used in NWP software, triggering a rethink of design choices for future software frameworks. To address the challenge of extreme-scale, energy-efficient high-performance computing, ECMWF is leading the ESCAPE project, a European funded project involving regional NWP centres, Universities, HPC centres and hardware vendors. The aim is not to reduce the stringent requirements for Earth-system prediction but to combine scientific and computer-science expertise for defining and co-designing the necessary steps towards affordable, exascale high-performance simulations of weather and climate.

GridTools is a set of libraries to execute stencil-like computations on a variety of different parallel architectures. The central component of GridTools is the stencil-composition library, which allows high-level composition of multiple stencil applications while the platform specific backends deal with its efficient execution. Other components deal with inter-node communication, boundary conditions and storage infrastructure. The target applications for GridTools are regional weather models (regular grids) as well as global weather and climate simulations (irregular grids). In this poster we describe the software structure and capabilities of the GridTools libraries. Currently supported architectures are clusters of multicore (x86) and multi-GPU nodes. We are currently working on supporting additional platforms, including Xeon Phi, and ARM based machines.

Pascal Spörri (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Climate & Weather
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Scientific codes run on a multitude of systems. Some of them are purely CPU based, others are hybrid machines containing accelerators. A performance-portable code makes it easy to transfer the code from one system to the next. We present a hybrid C++/Fortran approach that makes use of a C++ DSL called STELLA to obtain a performance portable (CPU/GPU) port of the COSMO dynamical core. The resulting code is used to compute the daily weather forecast at MeteoSwiss. We achieved a 1.5x speedup compared to the Fortran reference on CPU, and an additional 2.1x speedup on GPUs. With several extensions to STELLA we are able to automatically analyze and optimize the implementation. Enabling us to increase the performance of the code by an additional 1.4x on our production system. The project has been a success in terms of performance and maintainability. We are able to propose improvements to future implementations.

CLI-06 Large Scale Climate Simulations with COSMO
Presenter:
Hannes Vogt (ETH Zurich / CSCS, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Climate & Weather
+ Abstract
In recent years MeteoSwiss, C2SM, CSCS and ETH developed a GPU-enabled version of COSMO, a regional numerical weather prediction and climate model. A hybrid porting strategy that uses OpenACC directives for the physical parameterizations and a domain specific language for the dynamical core allows to retain a single source code that runs efficiently on traditional CPUs as well as NVIDIA GPUs. Thanks to this approach MeteoSwiss was able to increase the resolution of the operational weather forecasting model to 1.1 km. Furthermore climate simulations over Europe performed at ETH took profit from an increase in resolution to up to 2.2 km. In this work we show results on scalability of the model beyond 1000 GPUs on large domains on the Piz Daint supercomputer. Our effort demonstrates the usability of COSMO for near-global domains (excluding the poles) at high resolution, far outside the typical domain of a regional model.

CLI-07 Reproducible Climate and Weather Simulations: an Application to the COSMO Model
Presenter:
Christophe Charpilloz (MeteoSwiss, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Climate & Weather
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
We define bit-reproducibility as the ability of a simulation code to produce identical results across architectures. Such a feature offers many advantages ranging from testing and debugging simplification to a deployment maintaining numerical consistency. However achieving bit-reproducibility with a full-fledged weather and climate model may be perceived as a daunting task. In the crClim project we aim to obtain identical results on CPUs and GPUs with the COSMO model. We thus analyze COSMO to identify sources of non-reproducibility and propose strategies to solve them. Key sources of non-reproducibility stem from reductions, computation of transcendental functions and floating-point operation transformations by the compiler. To address these we avoid reductions, provide portable functions and control floating-point optimizations. Results indicate that bit-reproducibility across different hardware architecture is achievable and does not necessarily imply an excessive performance penalty. The penalty of the reproducible COSMO does not exceed 26% on CPU and 11% on GPU.

CSM-01 A Novel and Efficient Compressed Algorithm for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
Presenter:
Gabriele Torre (FHNW, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is one of the most popular decomposition techniques for multivariate data. NMF is a core method for many machine learning-related computational problems, such as data compression, feature extraction, word embedding, recommender systems etc. In practice, however, its application is facing challenges in recent years. These challenges stem from the fact that the datasets available are evergrowing in size. For large datasets, NMF algorithm efficiency poses demands on data loading and distribution into and within the available memory and communication between computational nodes. Here we present a novel and efficient compressed NMF algorithm. Our algorithm applies a random compression scheme to drastically reduce the dimensionality of the problem while preserving most of the action of the data matrix and inherently limiting the memory and communication load. As a consequence our algorithm supersedes existing methods in speed but it matches the best non-compressed algorithms in reconstruction precision.

Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
We present a resilient task-based domain-decomposition preconditioner for partial differential equations (PDEs) built on top of User Level Fault Mitigation Message Passing Interface (ULFM-MPI). The algorithm reformulates the PDE as a sampling problem, followed by a robust regression-based solution update resilient to silent data corruptions (SDCs). We adopt a server-client model where all state information is held by the servers, and clients only serve as computational units. The task-based nature of the algorithm and the capabilities of ULFM complement each other to support missing tasks, making the application resilient to clients failing. We present weak and strong scaling results showing that even in the presence of faults, scalability tested up to 50k cores is above 90% efficiency. We quantify the variability of weak and strong scaling due to the presence of faults and discuss the interplay between energy and resilience.

CSM-03 AV-Flow: A Software Library for Fluid Structure Interaction Problems Based on Variational Transfer Immersed Boundary Method
Presenter:
Marco Favino (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Track(s):

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
We present a new approach for Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) based on the variational transfer immersed boundary method, which has been realized in the software library AV-Flow. To this aim we couple a finite-element code for discretizing the equations of the solid structure with a finite-difference code used for simulating the fluid flow. Since it is known that the use of variational approaches represents an essential ingredient for the stable information transfer between non-matching overlapping meshes, in our framework a pseudo L2 projection approach is adopted to transfer data between the fluid and the solid grid. We provide a description of the complete methodology adopted to solve the FSI problem by including also details about the fluid and the solid solvers. Finally, for validating our methodology, we present results for an FSI benchmarking configuration describing the self induced oscillating deformations of an elastic beam in a flow channel.

Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
The presented poster concentrates on an efficient implementation of quadrature routines building the core of the boundary element method (BEM) for solving partial differential equations. We discuss two popular approaches treating the singular integrals specific for BEM, namely their regularization and subsequent four-dimensional tensor Gauss-Legendre scheme and the more challenging semi-analytic quadrature. We focus on manual vectorization of the routines by appropriate refactorization of underlying data structures and the utilization of OpenMP pragmas. The proposed techniques perform well for the standard BEM assembly as well as for the assembly accelerated by the adaptive cross approximation. Numerical experiments have been performed both on multi- and many-core systems including the Knights Landing processors representing the Intel Xeon Phi architecture. The discussed approach is implemented within the BEM4I library developed by the authors at the IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Center.

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
The energy consumption of supercomputers is one of the critical problems for the upcoming exascale supercomputing. This poster introduces the Horizon 2020 READEX project and its approach of dynamic application behavior analysis and tuning. The attention is paid to the manual application evaluation from the energy consumption point of view. This is the key step in exploring the possible gains of the runtime dynamic tuning. We present the effect of static and dynamic tuning of the CPU core frequency, CPU uncore frequency and the number of active cores on the energy consumption of an HPC cluster running selected workload. We have evaluated basic kernels with various computational intensity, parallel I/O and two full applications: ESPRESO FEM library with FETI solvers and open-source CFD tool OpenFOAM. The results show that these two complex applications can achieve energy savings of 21.3% and 17.7%, respectively, as a combination of static and dynamic tuning.

CSM-06 Efficient On-The-Fly Operator Assembly for HPC Finite Element codes
Presenter:
Simon Bauer (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany)
Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
A current trend in high-performance finite-element codes is to use \emph{matrix-free} approaches that either use an on-the-fly evaluation of the weak-form or alternatively on-the-fly computation and application of local stencils. While this alleviates the issue of memory-boundedness of the codes,in the case of problems on non-polyhedral domains assembly of the node stencils still constitutes a major portion of the overall runtime. We, recently, proposed a novel approach that replaces this expensive assembly by a low cost polynomial approximation. In our contribution we demonstrate, how this method can be extended to systems of PDEs and problems with varying coefficients. Since actual parallel efficiency is as important as algorithmic complexity we also detail a number the performance optimizations we performed to obtain excellent code performance and scalability. Furthermore we provide results of a geophysical simulation with real Earth data and a global resolution at the kilometer scale.

CSM-07 Flexible and High-Performance Stencil Codes with GridTools4Py
Presenter:
Alberto Madonna (ETH Zurich / CSCS, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Stencil codes perform a series of sweeps over arrays (2D or 3D) updating most or all elements. To update a data entry, p, the code accesses a pattern of neighboring cells around p; this pattern is called a “stencil”. Traditionally, stencil codes are written in low-level languages such as Fortran or C/C++ in order to achieve superior performance. These approaches, however, feature repetitive boilerplate code and face considerable challenges when implementing and validating complex scientific models. In this work, we present use cases for GridTools4Py (GT4Py), a Python package to define stencil operators at a high level, leveraging Python’s features and rich ecosystem to enable a fast and interactive development cycle. Users have the flexibility of executing stencil codes directly in Python for prototyping, or compile them into a high performance module, using the GridTools C++ library, all the while working from powerful frontends like Jupyter notebooks.

The human heart presents a challenge to numerical simulations, as it is a complex geometry and it includes deformable soft tissues. We address this challenge by presenting a Fluid-Structure interaction (FSI) approach, based on the immersed boundary (IB) method. Moreover, a semi-automatic procedure to get hybrid three dimensional heart meshes (structured for the fluid, unstructured for the soft tissue), based on the segmentation of patient specific data obtained by computed tomography (CT) scans, is presented.

CSM-09 Model-Driven Choice of PDE Numerical Solvers
Presenter:
Andrea Arteaga (MeteoSwiss, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Numerical methods to solve partial differential equations are typically chosen on the basis of personal preference, experience and numerical experiments. The crucial process of selecting a solution algorithm and its parameters is subject to a significant bias if a rigorous methodology is not employed. In this contribution we develop such a methodology to select the best suited solver for a given problem. In order to choose the solver which minimizes the runtime under an accuracy constraint, we define an optimization problem. We solve this problem by introducing models for the prediction of the accuracy and the performance of Finite Difference solvers. With numerical experiments performed on different architectures, we show how our methodology can effectively guide the selection process.

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Nobody needs yet an other data format for HPC. But why have so-called self-describing data formats never provided out-of-the-box cross application portability? Why are most open-access datasets not self-describing for both the domain scientist and after-use? And why do communities need to implement their data readers in various post-processing, visualization and analysis frameworks over and over again? We present the open meta data format openPMD for data format agnostic markup of particle-mesh data. Based on a minimal kernel of meta information and enriched with domain-specific extensions, we develop an open ecosystem of interoperable simulations and data processing frameworks from the domains of laser-plasma interaction, X-ray photon sciences, astrophysics up to systems biology. This poster presents our efforts to enable & establish workflows suitable to frictionless transposition between those domains, using highly scalable I/O methods (e.g. ADIOS BP or HDF5), a truly self-describing data markup and peer reviewed participation.

CSM-12 Parallel Immersed Boundary Simulations of Worm-Like Swimmers in the Inertial Flow Regime
Presenter:

Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Hydrodynamic interactions in suspensions of swimming organisms (active fluids) has been a topic of recent interest, especially in the study of collective motion of bacteria, spermatozoa and marine worms. To accurately capture the collective behavior of swimmers in both dilute and dense suspensions, it is essential that hydrodynamic interactions be captured. We are most interested in flows at moderate Reynolds numbers in the range from 0.1 to 100, in which both advective and diffusive effects are present and the fluid dynamics obey the Navier-Stokes equations. We employ the immersed boundary method to couple the elastic deformations of a swimming worm with the fluid, which yields a system of coupled integro-differential equations. To solve this system numerically, we employ a parallel immersed boundary algorithm that is implemented in C++. We simulate individual swimmer dynamics and pairwise interactions for worm-like organisms, where both synchronization and mutual attraction of nearby swimmers are observed.

CSM-13 Parallelization of Graph Partitioning using Metis and OpenMP
Presenter:
Rodrigo Pinto Coelho (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Algorithms that find optimal partitions for highly unstructured graphs have a wide range of applications. These applications include load balancing in super-computers, fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices and design of very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI). METIS is a well-known set of serial programs developed by the Karypis Lab designed to solve this problem. However, METIS was not originally designed to run in multiple processors. In this project we will use OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing), an API managed by the nonprofit consortium OpenMP Architecture Review Board, to parallelize METIS. We will then compare the parallelized version with the original METIS to gain an understanding of the performance improvements that can be obtained.

Neural networks trained on big datasets are usually large graphs that take up too much memory and are thus not suited for mobile devices. Recently various methods to reduce the size of these graphs have emerged which proves that this is problem is of interest for the community. The aim of this project is to develop a novel method to reduce the size of these large graphs by letting the network decide which nodes it finds most important for computation and removing the rest. Special type of neural networks called highway networks will be pruned as they allow us to find which nodes are being used most for computation for a particular input.

High Performance Computing (HPC) applications have to reliably run across many platforms and environments. Containers are a type of lightweight virtualization technology that attempts to solve this problem by packaging applications and their runtime environments into standard units of software that are: portable, easy to build and deploy, have a small footprint and a low runtime overhead. In this poster, we present a container workflow for HPC applications using two tools: Docker, for building and packaging applications into containers; and Shifter, a container runtime that has been built to fulfill the specific needs of HPC. We will present use cases of building and testing containers on workstations and deploying them on HPC systems, where they take advantage of the available specialized-hardware: fast interconnects and GPU accelerators. We will provide performance results for a variety of scientific applications and discuss how such workflow can aid HPC users.

CSM-16 Solving Large Scale Quadratic Programming Problems with PERMON
Presenter:
Vaclav Hapla (IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Center, Czech Republic)
Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
PERMON forms a collection of software libraries exploiting and extending PETSc. The PermonQP module aims to be a general purpose QP solver. It can be used within many application areas where QP problems arise, such as least-squares regression, data fitting, SVM, VRP, and many others. The underlying method is an alternative to more widely used Interior Point Methods. One of its advantages is that it allows very general, possibly implicit (unassembled, matrix-free) constraint and Hessian matrices. It consists in combination of QP transforms, particularly Lagrangian dualization, an outer loop based on augmented Lagrangian (SMALXE), and specific solvers for box-constrained QP. This combination allows solving a general class of QP problems. PermonFLLOP implements the TFETI domain decomposition method. It prepares TFETI-specific objects such as the gluing matrix and kernel basis, and then calls PermonQP to solve the resulting equality-constrained problem with additional inequality constraints in case of contact problems.

CSM-17 Load-Balanced Partition Refinement with the Graph p-Laplacian
Presenter:
Toby Simpson (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Spectral graph partitioning uses the second (Fiedler) eigenvector of the graph Laplacian matrix to approximate the NP-hard sparsest cut problem. Finding this eigenvector requires the minimisation of the Rayleigh quotient which is a 2-norm. We can improve on the approximation by minimising a p-norm and this defines the graph p-Laplacian eigenvalue problem. The approximation becomes sharp as the value of p is decreased from 2 to 1. During Cholesky factorisation of a sparse symmetric matrix the phenomenon of fill-in increases requirements for both memory and arithmetic operations. By permuting the matrix prior to factorisation we increase performance by maximising the sparsity of the Cholesky factor. If we consider the matrix as a sparse graph then finding the optimal permutation is equivalent to recursively solving the sparsest cut problem. We solve the p-Laplacian eigenvalue problem in linear time and improve on the current best fill-reducing software (METIS) by 10%.

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
In this poster presentation, we showcase our latest advances in fully generating massively parallel multigrid solvers for fluid flow problems. As input, abstract specifications given in our domain-specific language (DSL) ExaSlang -- short for ExaStencil language -- are considered. From that, our ExaStencils framework is able to generate C++ and CUDA code implementing efficient solvers.We compare two different applications, namely a simpler multigrid solver for Stokes flows and a more elaborate one for non-Newtonian fluid flows based on the full approximation scheme (FAS).In both cases, the computational domain is discretized using regular, non-uniform staggered grids. On them, the governing equations are discretized using finite volumes. We show how discretization and multigrid components are expressed in our DSL. For the latter, different smoothers such as distributive and Vanka-type ones are most interesting and the focus of our poster. Lastly, we draw a comparison between different solver and grid layouts.

EMD-01 Scalable MCMC Algorithm for the Accurate Estimation of Exponential Random Graph Models
Presenter:
Maksym Byshkin (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Emerging Domains in HPC
+ Abstract
The increase in the number and size of large network data sets requires novel efficient methods for their analysis. Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) are a general form of probability distribution widely applicable to the analysis of social and other networks. The scope of ERGMs is limited by the fact that existing estimation approaches rely on iterative computational methods that carry out large number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to draw equilibrium network configurations. Estimation approaches include Bayesian, maximum likelihood and the method of moments. We propose an accurate estimation approach, based on network properties at MCMC equilibrium, and design a simple and efficient algorithm that estimates model parameters several orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms. *Generous support from the Swiss National Platform of Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) is gratefully acknowledged.

ENG-01 A Multiscale Model for the Simulation of Sediment Impact Erosion of Metallic Targets
Presenter:
Sebastián Leguizamón (EPFL, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Engineering
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Erosion damage in hydraulic turbines is a common problem caused by the impact of small sediments entrained in the fluid. The current state-of-the-art simulations rely on CFD particle tracking coupled with erosion correlations that introduce great uncertainty and lack generality. A novel multiscale model of erosion is presented which avoids the use of correlations by explicitly simulating the sediment impacts. The problem is decoupled into its two dominant scales, each of which is solved using the Finite Volume Particle Method. On the microscale, the erosion rate is calculated by means of multi-particle impact simulations which include all the thermomechanical modeling required in the solid. On the macroscale, the sediment flux and impact condition distributions on the target are modeled through particle tracking in the fluid. Finally, a sequential multiscale algorithm allows reproducing the original coupled problem. The proposed model is validated against experimental data with satisfactory results.

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
The aim of the present research is to speed up a Finite Volume Particle Method (FVPM) solver utilizing GPU many-core architecture. FVPM is a conservative and consistent particle-based method which inherits interesting features of both Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and grid-based Finite Volume Method. SPHEROS is a versatile FVPM solver which has been developed at EPFL-LMH, for hydrodynamic simulation of hydraulic turbines and sediment erosion simulation. SPHEROS is able to handle the interaction between fluid, solid, and sediment. In order to accelerate SPHEROS, GPU-SPHEROS has been developed in CUDA featuring Thrust library and highly optimized kernels for both compute-bound and memory-bound algorithms. Up to now, remarkable speedup has been achieved for some parts including particle neighbor search and computing fluxes and forces and we are now focusing our efforts on the identified bottlenecks. The bottlenecks are mostly located in the computation of particles interaction vectors, which is based on spherical-support kernels.

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
We present the hemodynamics of a bioprosthetic heart valve. The heart valve is embedded in a parametric representation of the aortic root. We make use of sophisticated finer-reinforced material models for both the aortic tissue as well as the leaflet tissue. We obtain results by employing our in-house library for FSI problems. Following the concept of the Immersed Boundary Method, we discretize the respective domains with either finite elements or finite differences. Interchange of the discrete fields is performed with a variational transfer library. To manage stiffness of our coupled system we introduce accuracy based time step control through an embedded Runge-Kutta scheme. All parts of our code are MPI parallel and being adapted to today’s hybrid node supercomputers. We wish to provide this framework as an FSI library for other researchers in the future.

Track(s):

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Finding relevant information from complex, high-dimensional temporal series is a nontrivial task. We have recently introduced scalable data analysis tools for the unsupervised mining of such data, viz., the so-called progress index method (Bloechliger et al. (2013), Comput. Phys. Comm. 184, pp. 2446) and resultant SAPPHIRE plots. With shared memory implementations in place for the key algorithmic components, this tool as implemented in the CAMPARI software package (http://campari.sourceforge.net) is able to take advantage of modern HPC resources. It is, however, equally important to provide ease of access across platforms and devices to increase awareness and familiarity with these data mining algorithms. We thus developed and present here a salient implementation of the core algorithms in the R package CampaR1, which has been deposited on CRAN. This wrapper has been designed such that it is able to analyze any kind of data that can be processed by R.

Presenter:
Gianvito Grasso (Scuola universitaria professionale della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Track(s):

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
The future success of nucleic acids as therapeutic agents is strongly related with the design of efficient drug delivery technologies. Cationic polymers represent an attractive strategy to serve as drug carriers with the envisioned advantages of efficient complexation, low cost, and ease of production. However, the balance between efficacy and toxicity of these polymers is still a bottleneck. In the present work, the binding mechanism of polyarginine, polylysine and polyethyleneimine to a model siRNA target is computationally investigated at atomistic level. Replica exchange molecular dynamics in combination with metadynamics simulations elucidate how polymer flexibility, charge density, and molecular geometry affect the siRNA-polycations free energy landscapes. The results reveal that comparable polyarginine and polylysine show advantageous binding properties compared to polyethyleneimine. In brief, significant differences among lowest energy binding modes have been detected. These results could be helpful in the future design of potent and selective nucleic acids drug carrier polymers.

Hadi Zolfaghari (University of Bern, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Life Sciences
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
A massively-parallel 3D Navier-Stokes solver has been accelerated on the GPUs. The solver is used for heart valve simulations, where Immersed Boundary Method is adopted for coupling the fluid and soft tissue domains. Computationally expensive routines of this solver have been offloaded to the GPGPUs of Cray XC50 supercomputer (Piz Daint). The differential kernels such as Jacobi multigrid smoothers were developed with CUDA C API and then wrapped in FORTRAN for integration in the flow solver. The GPU-accelerated kernels were benchmarked on Fermi and Pascal GPUs, resulting in 5x and 20x speedup, respectively. Briskly on Pascal, 33x speedup was achieved by adopting CUDA multi-process service together with MPI. Finally, we performed extensive numerical simulations for investigating the flow instabilities past the aortic sinus cavity.

LS-05 Focused Diversification of Biomolecules for Drug Discovery by Progress Index-Guided Sampling
Presenter:
Cassiano Langini (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Life Sciences
+ Abstract
The efficient exploration of relevant areas of phase space represents a major challenge in molecular simulations of biological systems. Enhanced sampling protocols try to address this challenge. Progress index-guided sampling evolves several copies of the system in parallel, and sampling redundancy is eliminated by periodically replacing copies exploring the same regions of phase space with less visited conformations. The discovery of new states is driven by spontaneous fluctuations alone. The reseeding heuristic relies on a representation of the system that can be tuned to obtain focused diversification of specific degrees of freedom. By coupling a molecular dynamics code that is efficient on the single node level to an MPI layer managing the reseeding heuristic, the protocol is able to take full advantage of modern HPC resources. Here, we demonstrate that we achieve the focused diversification of two distinct loops in four bromodomains, which are drug targets in epigenetics research.

LS-06 Funnel-Metadynamics 2.0: Graphical User Interface and Implementation in Plumed 2
Presenter:
Stefano Raniolo (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Life Sciences
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Funnel Metadynamics (FM) is a computational method proven to be successful in obtaining an accurate estimation of the binding affinity between two molecules (Limongelli et al. PNAS 2013, Troussicot et al. JACS 2015, Comitani et al. JCTC 2016, Moraca et al. PNAS 2017). In this approach, the use of a funnel-shaped restraining potential allows enhancing the exploration of the ligand bound poses and its solvated states leading to an accurate description of the protein-ligand binding free energy surface. This approach allows investigating further important aspects of the binding process, such as the presence of alternative binding modes and the role of the solvent. FM has proven to be successful in reproducing the available experimental data, such as crystallographic binding modes and experimental binding free energies (Limongelli et al. PNAS 2013; Troussicot et al. JACS 2015), resulting a most valuable tool to study ligand/protein and ligand/DNA binding interactions.

PHY-01 Formation of Solid H2 in the ISM
Presenter:
Andreas Füglistaler (University of Geneva, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Physics
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
We study the formation of cold, substellar sized bodies due to the fragmentation of gravitationally unstable fluids in a phase transition. The main interest is the potential formation of solid H2 in the ISM. H2 condensation conditions can be reached in dense substellar structures and during a plane-parallel contraction, where the temperature rise is only of a factor 2. Linear analysis shows that fluids in a phase transition are always gravitationally unstable, because compression does not increase pressure, but the condensed phase fraction. The non-linear dynamics of fluids in and out of a phase transition are studied using the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS. Supermolecules are used to combine the Lennard-Jones and gravitational potential. The simulations confirm that fluids presenting a phase transition are gravitationally unstable, independent of the strength of the gravitational potential. The instabilities produce a wide spectrum of ice clumps, from small oligomers to gravitationally bound planetoids.

Aaron Scheinberg (EPFL, Switzerland)
Track(s):

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Numerical plasma physics models are used to improve our understanding of transport, instability growth and other poorly understood phenomena encountered in the experimental devices edging toward viable fusion energy. Since computational expense imposes a major limitation on accurate physical modeling, computational resources must be used as efficiently as possible. Here, we examine four recent features in the particle-in-cell (PIC) code ORB5: a structural change to optimize calculations on "gyropoints" (rather than gyroaveraged particle position); array structure changes; precomputational particle sorting; and the implementation of a hybrid parallelization using OpenMP (in addition to the existing MPI parallelization). We demonstrate the speedup, and thus time and resource savings, achieved by implementing these changes in the major modules of PIC gyrokinetic codes.

PHY-04 The Linear Polarization of the Solar Continuum Radiation from Numerical Simulations of the Solar Atmosphere
Presenter:
Flavio Calvo (Istituto Ricerche Solari Locarno, Switzerland)
Track(s):

+ Abstract
+ Presentation
We use numerical radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the near surface layers of the Sun that we have carried out at CSCS to produce synthetic observations (maps), both in intensity and linear polarization of the continuum radiation and at a variety of positions on the solar disk. The synthetic maps are produced by solving the radiative transfer equation for polarized light in three-dimensional space. The polarization at disk centre comes about because of deviations of the three-dimensional structure of the atmosphere from a plane-parallel model atmosphere. Spatial averages as a function of distance between centre and limb of the solar disk display the same behaviour as obtained with one-dimensional models and agree with measurements carried out at IRSOL.

Large-scale computational simulations have become a key tool in fluid-structure interaction research. The investigation of fundamental flow principles and the interaction of blood cells with surrounding plasma have necessitated the use of high-performance computing and high-fidelity computational methods.  The need for massively parallel simulation of particle-laden fluids has driven the development of novel multiscale coupling techniques to enable high-resolution FSI modeling in complex topologies. This symposium will bring together developers of state-of-the-art multiscale and multiphysics models of hemodynamics with a particular emphasis on rheology and transport phenomena. The set of talks will showcase a range of techniques used to simulate different cell-types in an extensible and scalable manner while highlighting recent advances in computational hemodynamics. This symposium will provide a platform to identify cross-cutting challenges and opportunities for future research.

Blood Rheology in Complex Geometries
Presenter:
Eva Athena Economides (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Recent advances in medical research and bio-engineering have led to the development of devices capable of handling fluids and biological matter at the microscale. The operating conditions of such devices are constrained in order to ensure that the mechanical properties and local hemodynamics of blood are not altered during operation. These properties are a consequence of the red blood cell (RBC) microstructure, which changes according to the device geometry. The understanding of the mechanics and dynamics that govern the interactions between the RBCs is crucial for the quantitative characterization of blood flow. Through simulations of individual RBCs, a detailed characterization of the suspended blood cells can be made and directly connect the macroscopic properties (e.g. viscosity) to specific RBC conformations. In this work we present a quantification of the microstructure in high and low hematocrit blood flows in wall bounded geometries, and make connections to the measured viscosity.

Numerical Simulation of a Compound Capsule in a Constricted Microchannel
Presenter:
John Gounley (Duke University, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Simulations of the passage of eukaryotic cells through a constricted channel aid in studying the properties of cancer cells and their transport through the bloodstream. Compound capsules, which explicitly model the outer cell membrane and nuclear lamina, have the potential to improve fidelity of computational models. However, general simulations of compound capsules through a constricted microchannel have not been conducted and the influence of the compound capsule model on computational performance is not well known. In this study, we extend a parallel hemodynamics application to simulate the fluid-structure interaction between compound capsules and fluid. With this framework, we compare the deformation of simple and compound capsules in constricted microchannels, and explore how this deformation depends on the capillary number and on the volume fraction of the inner membrane. The parallel performance of the computational framework in this setting is evaluated and lessons for future development are discussed.

Cell-Based Blood Flow Simulations, Validations, Rheology, and Transport Phenomena
Presenter:
Britt J. M. van Rooij (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands)
+ Abstract
In the current work we present Hemocell, a high-performance computational framework with validated cell-material models. It is targeted to provide the necessary tools to address challenging biophysical questions in relation to blood flows, e.g. the influence of transport characteristics on platelet bonding and aggregation or the behavior of white blood cell trafficking during inflammatory processes. Within the framework the dynamics of blood plasma are resolved by applying the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), while the cellular membranes are implemented using a discrete element method (DEM) coupled to the fluid as immersed boundary method (IBM) surfaces. The validation of the constitutive models shows that Hemocell is capable of reproducing the emergent transport characteristics of such a complex cellular system with high accuracy while allowing for domain sizes that reach into the macroscopic scale.

Emerging Domains in HPC, Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person. Although the idea has been a part of healthcare for many years (e.g. blood transfusions), research in precision medicine has spurred a lot of interest recently due to the accessibility to large volumes of complex genomics and other biomedical datasets as well as digitized medical records and the development of novel methods and tools in data science. Sound, interoperable high-performance computing and “Big Data” analytics and management infrastructures are key to the success of research programs such as the “Swiss Personalized Health Network” (SPHN) initiative starting in 2017. These infrastructures will have to be built in collaboration and coordination between hospitals and universities to allow researchers to perform biomedical research on real patient data beyond institutional and geographical boundaries. A particular challenge of this novel infrastructure is the combination of high-performance and Big Data storage and computing resources and data management services with high data security and compliance requirements, so it can fulfill the regulations of the respective federal laws (in Switzerland, particularly the Human Research Act (Humanforschungsgesetz, HFG)) and international best practices in the field. This minisymposium aims at bringing together experts from biomedical research, hospital and university computing and data service providers, as well as from the side of Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI), and will put the subject into the larger perspective of the upcoming Swiss national research initiative on personalized health care.

Precision Medicine: Paving the way for Responsible Data Access and Governance
Presenter:
Alessandro Blasimme (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Precision medicine relies on the availability of multiple data types, collected from a host of different sources. The prospect of circulating large amounts of personal data, or making them widely available for analysis generates a host of novel ethical issues, spanning from appropriate consent mechanisms to privacy protection and accountability. As a consequence, establishing an ethically sound framework for responsible data access is going to be key for the successful development of precision medicine. To this aim, we present the results of a comprehensive analysis of international guidelines and policies concerning access to health data in the context of research. Drawing on such analysis, we also set out to offer an ethical framework for responsible data access within precision medicine data infrastructures. Our framework, we argue, can help overcome the limitations of current ethical tools, and cope with the new challenges posed by data-intense biomedical research.

Leonhard Med: ETH's Answer to the IT Challenges of Personalized Health Research
Presenter:
Bernd Rinn (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Research in personalized health requires a robust, performant and safe data and computing environment. Interoperability between participating medical and academic research centers is key as data come from many and heterogeneous sources, e.g. hospital patient data, personalized OMICS data, systems biology research data and reference data. Bringing those data together, analyzing them and maintaining the data provenance while ensuring legal and ethical compliance is a challenging task. When building up a suitable environment at ETH, we found three areas to require special attention: (i) making a high-performance computing environment fit for handling sensitive patient data, (ii) design of inter-operable data analysis pipelines to allow moving analysis code to data rather than vice versa; (iii) managing data and tracking the data provenance for large-scale sensitive data analysis across institutions. In this talk, we will report on our progress on dealing with these areas in ETH’s new “Leonhard Med” medical data and computing environment. Emphasize will be given to the interdependence among such efforts and thus the need of a high level of integration in order to enable this highly interdisciplinary domain of research.

Presenter:
Torsten Schwede (University of Basel, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
The Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) initiative aims to bring Switzerland to the forefront of personalized health research by establishing nationwide interoperability of biomedical information. Thanks to advances in life sciences, analytical techniques and information technology, both the quality and quantity of data relevant for biomedical research have been increasing dramatically in recent years. Besides systematic research projects, increasing amounts of data are generated as part of routine clinical care, observational studies, and even by individual citizens monitoring themselves ("quantified self"). The "SPHN Data Coordination Center (DCC)" at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics will address the technical and semantic challenges of data interoperability to enable scientists to efficiently use and analyze Swiss health-related data in a meaningful way. The growing amount of detailed information on individuals provides an unprecedented opportunity for advancing biomedical research and answering today’s research questions with respect to precision medicine and human health.

From Big Genomic Data to Molecular Insights
Presenter:
Gunnar Rätsch (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
This talk will discuss the technical challenges with respect to two large cancer genome initiatives. Within the International Cancer Genome Consortium, we performed a large collaborative study involving whole genome and RNA-sequencing of 27 types of tumors from about 1,200 donors originating from more than 20 countries. We describe the challenges of distributed, collaborative data analysis under compliance constraints. I will also describe the analysis of about 10,000 samples with whole-exome and RNA sequencing to identify RNA splicing differences that are the result of somatic mutations in tumors. The analysis involved processing about 300TB of raw sequencing data and the association testing using linear mixed models of ca. 200,000 phenotypes against about 50,000 somatic mutations. Most of the analysis was performed using ETH’s Euler and LeonardMed compute systems; the latter is providing sufficient I/O bandwidth to perform such studies.

Emerging Domains in HPC, Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
Recent years have seen a dramatic explosion in an amount and precision of available raw data. Large amounts of measured and simulated information from all kinds of processes have been accumulated in a wide range of areas - from weather and climate research to astrophysics and neuroscience. If knowledge about such systems is present only in the form of observations or measurement data, the challenging problem of understanding the system becomes a problem of pattern recognition and model reduction in multiple dimensions. Optimization methods have manifested themselves as a central pillar for practical implementations of these data analysis problems, allowing a unified handling of a wide variety of data analysis algorithms. These include clustering methods (standard K-means, fuzzy-C-means, or Fuzzy Clustering based on Regression Models (FCRM)) as well as of the more advanced methods based on concepts from Artificial Neuronal Networks (ANNs) and nonparametric/nonstationary data analysis. A central challenge in solving such data analysis problems lies in not imposing too many – potentially inappropriate – a priori assumptions on the available data. Also in this respect recent advances in high-performance optimisation methods can assist development of data analysis methods, through appropriate regularisation concepts and related tools. Recent progress in GPU-based high-performance computing implementations of optimisation methods enables us now to apply these techniques to ever larger problems, for instance from causality inference, image denoising, data compression, market phases identification in finance - among many others. In this minisymposium we will discuss the current state of the art in the optimisation-driven multidimensional data analysis problems, understand their parallel programming issues – particularly in a view of the emergence of disruptive processor technology, such as clusters of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and other accelerators (e.g., Intel Xeon Phi) – and hear about their application to various data analysis problems from different areas. Also recent work on the development of community libraries for HPC optimisation software will be presented.

High Performance Implementation of FEM-H1 Approach to Clustering and Denoising of Multidimensional Time Series
Presenter:
Lukas Pospisil (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
We review the most recent development of a data-driven approach to causality inference in multivariate time series, improving on classical approaches to causality analysis such as Granger causality by accommodating general forms of nonstationarity and non-homogeneity resulting from unresolved and latent-scale effects. Emerging causality framework results in, and is implemented by way of, a clustering of time series based on a minimization of the averaged clustering functional, which describes the mean distance between observation data and its representation in terms of given number of abstract Bayesian causality models of a certain predefined class. The time series analysis and clustering FEM-H1 framework is implemented through a new open-source HPC library using the PETSc framework to target multiple platforms, such as CPU, GPU, and Xeon Phi. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method and our implementation for solving challenging large-scaled benchmarks on CSCS Piz Daint supercomputer.

The Quiet Atmosphere: Data-Driven Ideas for Bridging the Gap Between Observed and Modeled Nocturnal Turbulence.
Presenter:
Nikki Vercauteren (Freie Universität Berlin, Germany)
+ Abstract
Boundary-layer turbulence at night, in stably stratified weak-wind conditions, is typically intermittent and generated partly by shear associated with propagating non-turbulent motions on the so-called submesoscales (corresponding roughly to scales smaller than 2km). These non-turbulent motions can include ramp-cliff patterns, waves or microfronts and are commonly denoted as submesomotions. The diversity of submesomotions complicates the identification of specific physical mechanisms that would potentially trigger intermittent turbulence, making the representation of nocturnal turbulence in weather forecasting models a challenging task. In this context, recently developed methods of nonstationary data analysis represent a promising tool to extract knowledge about yet unknown turbulence triggering mechanisms from observational datasets of atmospheric turbulence. We will show that a combination of clustering methods developed for nonstationary data analysis and taking into account external influences can identify different flow regimes and give insights about the patterns of flow motions susceptible to influence turbulent mixing.

On Memory, Dimension, and Atmospheric Teleconnections
Presenter:
Didier Paolo Monselesan (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia)
+ Abstract
Using an atmospheric reanalysis and applying multi-scale approximations to non-stationary dynamical processes, the role of memory and dimensionality in defining the metastable states of the troposphere is examined. The impact of various strategies for dimension reduction based on PCA, diagonalisation, and truncation are considered. Memory effects are modeled by VAR processes. We separate barotropic and baroclinic processes and test models sensitivity to the number and type of retained principal components. The identified tropospheric physical modes depend on the number of PCs and lags. We find circumglobal teleconnections in both hemispheres at lags < 2 and contrast the transient nature and zonal structure of the Southern Hemisphere patterns with their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. Overfitted models yield structures consistent with the major teleconnection modes, replaced by zonally oriented wavetrains when memory effects are ignored or when the dimension is reduced via diagonalising. Where baroclinic processes are emphasized, circumpolar wavetrains are manifest.

Deep Learning Classification of Radio Astronomy Images
Presenter:
Claudio Gheller (ETH Zurich / CSCS, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
The challenge for future radio observations is the detection of the faint gas emission from cosmological filaments, at the edge of detectability by instruments like LOFAR or SKA. This requires specific software to be disentangled from the noise that dominates the images. The software not only have to de-noise images, but also to support automatic classification, since the expected overwhelming data volumes rule out any human supervision. These characteristics can be found in Deep Learning algorithms. We aim at applying a Convolutional Neural Network algorithm to images from radio telescopes, focusing on the detection of faint extended sources. Once properly trained, the network can automatically and quickly analyze images. All the relevant features and parameters of the network have been tuned to work effectively on our low signal-to-noise images. The Tensorflow library was adopted being open source, supporting a broad variety of machine learning algorithms and running effectively on GPUs.
MS35 High-Throughput Computing on Emerging HPC Platforms for Particle Detectors at The Large Hadron Collider (1/2): Online Computing , Room B2

Physics
Understanding the basic building blocks of matter is amongst the most formidable ventures humanity has undertaken. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its associated experiments have allowed us to observe the particles and processes that lie at the foundation of our current understanding of the physical world. Furthermore, the LHC and other high-energy physics (HEP) facilities continue to produce data at an ever increasing rate, allowing us to peer beyond the Standard Model. In order to filter, process, and analyze the data captured at particle detectors, the HEP community has had over the last decades an insatiable appetite for computing power. Today the LHC experiments record around 150 PB/year. The rate of interactions to be studied will increase by a factor of 100 in the next 10 to 15 years. Computing at the LHC experiments happens mostly in two domains. In Online Computing, data captured at the detector must be processed and filtered using near-realtime, high-throughput computing software frameworks. The reconstruction of a particle collision event employs a large number of complex algorithms before the results are stored for further analysis. Offline computing deals with the physics analysis of the large data sets captured by the detector and retained by the online computing software. In this session we take a closer look at detector simulation and data analysis in HEP experiments. Much work has been devoted in recent years to further develop the existing software frameworks to better take advantage of modern hardware architectures. This includes shared-memory parallelism, vectorization and support for coprocessors and accelerators. Furthermore, the recent advancements in the field of machine learning are finding a number of applications in high-energy physics. The presentations discuss these simulation and data-analysis frameworks in the context of high-performance computing and modern hardware architectures.

Computing at CERN: Challenges and Opportunities
Presenter:
Omar Awile (CERN, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
As the demand for computing power and throughput grows, propelled by increasing particle detector output, computing in high-energy physics must continue innovating. At CERN, a distinction is made between online and offline computing. Online computing is the processing, filtering, and storage of data acquired through the particle detectors at near realtime: current-generation detectors produce ca. 100TB/s data combined, reduced to 25 PB/year. Offline computing is the statistical analysis of stored experimental data, and performed on a worldwide computing grid of 150 participating institutions. The continued increase in detector data output and a shift in computer hardware design from serial/scalar to parallel/vectorized architectures pose significant challenges to the HEP computing community. Changes in hardware and software infrastructures should allow experiments to continue to collect, process, and analyze data for years to come. I will give a brief overview of the LHC and CERN's computing history and discuss current and future challenges.

HEP Realtime Analysis: Scaling Beyond Embarrassing Parallel
Presenter:
Gerhard Raven (VU University Amsterdam, Netherlands)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
The LHC collides bunches of protons every 25 ns. This is reflected in the data stream generated by its detectors: it can be chopped up into so-called events, each corresponding to the data generated in 25 ns intervals. Historically, events have been the basic 'quantum' of scheduling the processing of this data stream, as each event can be analyzed separately. HEP has been able to take advantage of the embarrassingly parallel nature of this problem to scale up its data processing to the systems in use today. But as the intensity of the LHC increases, events become more complex, and their analysis becomes more intricate. When combined with the changing computing landscape it has become clear that just scaling the existing architecture will no longer suffice. This talk will address the challenges posed and describe how the LHCb collaboration is changing its online data processing strategy to meet them.

High Performance Computing Meets High Energy Physics
Presenter:
Daniel Hugo Campora Perez (University of Seville, Spain)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
In 2020, the LHCb detector will be upgraded, and as a consequence, it will generate a data throughput of up to 30 Tbit/s. The data will then be filtered in a software-based trigger for interesting particle collisions. The design of such a system poses performance challenges in the interconnect, compute hardware platforms and software infrastructure. The High Throughput Computing Collaboration (HTCC) is investigating the use of next-generation Intel hardware technologies in this context. In this presentation we will show results from our network infrastructure feasibility studies on 100 G interconnects. In addition, we present new developments on vectorized and thread-parallelized algorithms used in the Online reconstruction software. In order to fully take advantage of modern hardware platforms, alternatives to the existing implementations that exploit SIMD capabilities and multi/manycore architectures are being explored. Performance is measured and compared across a variety of architectures taking into account the cost and energy requirements.

Heterogeneous Event Selection at the CMS Experiment
Presenter:
Felice Pantaleo (CERN, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Starting from 2020, during the Large Hadron Collider Runs 3 and 4, the increased accelerator luminosity with the consequently increased number of simultaneous proton-proton collisions (pile-up) will pose significant new challenges for the CMS experiment. The reconstruction of the trajectories of charged particles recorded in the silicon pixel and strip detectors is one of the most important components of the interpretation of the detector information of a proton-proton collision. The increasing complexity of events, due to the growing number of simultaneous proton-proton collisions, will make track reconstruction especially challenging. GPUs are becoming wider, and their width is expected to increase in the following years. A many-threads-per-event approach would scale with the pileup, by offloading the combinatorics to the number of threads available on the GPU. This would allow a faster execution of track reconstruction and physics selection algorithms in charge of accepting the events with the most interesting physics content.

The elucidation of biological processes passes through different experimental protocols that are used to dissect intricate reactions in several small pieces, thus obtaining simplified models of the entire process. Computer simulations have been used since the early 70s to study the physical and chemical properties of biomolecules and they have played in the recent years an even more relevant role in elucidating, complementing and also predicting the experimental observables. The chemical reactivity of biomolecules can be studied in-silico at different levels of accuracy and dimension using electron-based, atom-based, and multiscale models. The choice among the different approaches depends on the property of the system the scientists aim to investigate. Electron transfer reactions, ligand/protein binding, and protein-protein interactions are only a few examples of the biological processes that can be investigated through computer simulations. The main limitations of the computational approaches are represented by: - Timescale of the biological processes; - Size of the system to simulate; - Accuracy in the system’s description; The continuous effort of the scientific community to overcome such limitations has led to important advances represented by the development of novel methods and the improved performance of the simulation codes on the modern-day computer architectures such as high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. The scientific literature shows many successful examples where simulations unravel complex biochemical problems and some of those are illustrated in the present minisymposium. The minisymposium also represents an opportunity, particularly for young researchers, to discuss with some of the word-leading scientists in the field the state-of-the-art simulation techniques and draw a line towards the future of biomolecular simulations.

Computational Challenges in Photobiology and Ultrafast Spectroscopy
Presenter:
Ivan Rivalta (École normale supérieure de Lyon, France)
+ Abstract
Light-induced reactions are ubiquitous in biological processes, including vision, DNA/RNA photodamage, photosynthesis and bioluminescence. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms regulating these natural processes is of great importance for developing innovative technologies in biomedical and energy sciences. Accurate characterization of photophysical properties and photochemical pathways occurring in photo-induced processes is quite challenging, even for the most advanced computational and experimental techniques. First-principles simulations ensuring reliable description of excited states and ultrafast laser spectroscopies are indeed necessary to gain insights into complex light-induced processes. I will illustrate applications of hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanics methods and ab initio on-the-fly semiclassical dynamics techniques to the study of retinal photochemistry in solution and in biological pigments involved in ultraviolet vision. Our recent developments of computational tools and protocols for first-principles simulations of ultrafast bidimensional electronic spectra will be also introduced along with their application to the study of proteic systems, retinals, organic fluorescent probes and DNA/RNA nucleobases.

High-Resolution, Integrative Modeling of Biomolecular Complexes From Fuzzy Data
Presenter:
Alexandre Bonvin (Utrecht University, Netherlands)
+ Abstract
The prediction of the quaternary structure of biomolecular macromolecules is of paramount importance for fundamental understanding of cellular processes and drug design. In the era of integrative structural biology, one way of increasing the accuracy of modelling methods used to predict the structure of biomolecular complexes is to include as much experimental or predictive information as possible in the process. We have developed for this purpose a versatile flexible information-driven docking approach HADDOCK (http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2). HADDOCK can integrate information derived from biochemical, biophysical or bioinformatics methods to enhance sampling, scoring, or both. The information that can be integrated is quite diverse: interface restraints from NMR, mutagenesis experiments or bioinformatics predictions; shape data from small-angle X-ray scattering, and, recently, cryo-electron microscopy experiments. In my talk, I will illustrate HADDOCK’s capabilities with various examples, including protein-peptide and protein ligand complexes.

A Comprehensive Description of the Homo and Heterodimerization Mechanism of the Chemokine Receptors CCR5 and CXCR4
Presenter:
Daniele Di Marino (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Signal transduction across cellular membranes is controlled by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is widely accepted that members of the GPCRs family self-assemble forming dimers or higher-order oilogomers but the functional consequences of the dimerization was described only for few receptors. The chemokines receptors are GPCRs implicated in the functioning and maintenance of the immune system. These receptors represent prime targets for therapeutic intervention in a wide spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, and HIV. Combining coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics (MetaD) we are able to describe the mechanism of dimers formation, capturing multiple association and dissociation events allowing us to compute a detailed free energy landscape of the process. CG-MetaD is an enhanced sampling method particularly suitable to describe processes with very slow rates of interconversion among the possible states of the system.

Enhanced Sampling Approaches in Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Presenter:
Michele Parrinello (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
In many fields of science, computer simulations are pervasively used to solve difficult problems. Many systems of interest exhibit long lived metastable states separated by high barriers, and only rarely occurring fluctuations allow the system to cross these barriers. This makes the transitions from one metastable state to another rare events. Although rare, these events are crucial for a correct description of the system. Phenomena such as nucleation and protein folding are examples of rare events. Unfortunately, the time scale of standard simulation falls short of what's needed. We present a novel approach to this problem, based on the introduction of a variational principle. We show how this variational principle can be used to study complex problems and calculate transition rates of rare events. We underline that besides offering computational efficiency this new approach provides a qualitative new point of view that will have far reaching consequences in the future.

Computational nanoelectronics is an emerging scientific area that leads to several challenging mathematical problems such as the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, density functional theory, covariance matrix analysis in uncertainty quantification or dynamic mean field theory, just to mention some of the topics. These aspects require high-performance computing methods just because of their mathematical and algorithmic complexity. Methods for high-performance computing include solving large-scale eigenvalue problems, the selective inversion of parts of a large-scale matrix, solving several linear systems and many more.

Numerical Linear Algebra Techniques for Accelerating Electronic Structure Calculations
Presenter:
Chao Yang (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, United States of America)
+ Abstract
We describe two recently developed numerical linear algebra techniques for accelerating electronic structure calculations. In particular, we discuss the use of the selected inversion algorithm for reducing the cubic scaling of conventional Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) based electronic structure calculation to at most quadratic, and show how this method can be implemented efficiently on distributed memory parallel computers. We will also examine the use of polynomial filtering in DGDFT, which is a massively parallel KSDFT solver that uses an adaptive local basis set to discretized the Kohn-Sham equation, and show the benefit of this technique for 3D problems.

Scalable Parallel Sparse Matrix Computations
Presenter:
Ahmed Sameh (Purdue University, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Sparse matrix computations arise in numerous computational science and engineering applications such as computational nanoelectronics. In order to insure effective use of parallel architectures, one often needs to design afresh sparse matrix primitives and algorithms that are capable of reducing memory references and interprocessor communications. In this presentation, we describe: (i) hybrid parallel algorithms for solving sparse linear systems, and (ii) a parallel algorithm for obtaining a few of the eigenpairs of symmetric generalized eigenvalue problems. Numerical experiments that demonstrate the robustness and parallel scalability of these algorithms are conducted, and comparisons made with established linear system and symmetric eigenvalue problem solvers.

Densities of States: Algorithms and Applications in Linear Algebra
Presenter:
Yousef Saad (University of Minnesota, United States of America)
+ Abstract
This talk will first discuss how the basic tool of trace estimation has been exploited to compute densities of states, i.e., spectral densities. Then various effective algorithms to estimate thesedensities will be presented. Approximate densities of states can be very helpful in a variety of situations and the second part of the talk will cover a few of these. The first application we discuss is that of determining the number of eigenvalues of a matrix that are located in a given interval. A special case of this is the approximation of the rank of a matrix. The density of states is also an ideal tool for "spectrum slicing", i.e., the technique of subdividing a given interval into sub-intervals in which different parts of the spectrum are computed independently. Finally, a somewhat related problem is that of developing low-rank approximate inverse preconditioners for solving linear systems.

+ Abstract
Realistic first-principle quantum simulations applied to large-scale atomistic systems pose unique challenges in the design of numerical algorithms that are both capable of processing a considerable amount of generated data, and achieving significant parallel scalability on modern high-end computing architectures. From atoms and molecules to nanostructures, we discuss how the FEAST eigensolver has considerably broadened the perspectives for enabling reliable and high-performance large-scale first-principle all-electrons DFT and real-time TDDFT calculations. Parallel performances and various numerical electronic spectroscopy results will be presented and discussed.

Physics, Engineering
Active Matter is an emerging field of Physics that studies a variety of systems composed of entities that can actively consume energy to convert it into motion. Biological examples of active matter range in scale by many orders of magnitude from swarms of motile bacteria to schools of fish. They can together exhibit such phenomena as collective motion and dynamic self-organization. Understanding the basic principles governing inherently non-equilibrium active matter is a difficult challenge. One of the approaches to achieve this goal is to create synthetic systems that can reproduce behaviors typical for living matter, which can be studied to understand complex phenomena emerging in active matter. Computational modeling plays a critical role in this process enabling both better understanding of biological systems and devising synthetic systems that can be then experimentally tested. This minisymposium will discuss recent computational advances and challenges in the field of Active Matter.

Collective Motion of Gel-Actuated Micro-Swimmers
Presenter:
Alexander Alexeev (Georgia Institute of Technology, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Advances in polymers have enabled the development of novel materials that can reversibly change the shape controlled by external stimuli. We use mesoscale modeling to probe how these stimuli-sensitive synthetic materials can be used to design self-propelling microscopic swimmers. Our swimmers are made of a bi-layered hydrogel sheet composed of layers with distinct sensitivities to external stimuli. When a stimulus is introduced, one of the layers swells causing the body of our X-shaped micro-swimmer to bend. Upon stimulus removal, the responsive layer contracts and the micro-swimmer recovers its initial flat shape. We first use dissipative particle dynamics to model hydrogel swimmer and explore the physics of its propulsion through a viscous solvent. We use the computational model to probe how material properties affect the swimming speed. We then employ lattice-Boltzmann simulations to investigate the collective behavior of suspensions of these swimmers in confined and unbounded environments.

Equilibrium Physics Breakdown Reveals the Active Nature of Red Blood Cell Flickering
Presenter:
Dmitry Fedosov (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany)
+ Abstract
Red blood cells are seen to flicker under optical microscopy, a phenomenon initially described as thermal fluctuations of the cell membrane. However, recent studies have suggested the involvement of non-equilibrium processes, without definitively ruling out equilibrium interpretations. Using active and passive microrheology to directly compare the membrane response and fluctuations on single cells, we find a violation of the fluctuation–dissipation relation, which is a direct demonstration of the non-equilibrium nature of flickering. With realistic stochastic simulations and an analytical model of the composite erythrocyte membrane, we show that several molecular mechanisms (e.g., spectrin network remodeling and ion pumps) may explain the active fluctuations, and we predict their kinetics. We are also able to quantitatively extract RBC membrane properties including shear elasticity, bending rigidity, and membrane viscosity. Our findings provide solid experimental and theoretical frameworks for future investigations of the origin and function of active motion in cells.

Prediction of Salt-Responsive Behavior of Polyelectrolyte Micelles and Gels
Presenter:
Yaroslava G. Yingling (North Carolina State University, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Responsive materials will play an increasingly important part in a diverse range of applications. However, the mechanisms of responsiveness are difficult to characterize due to its inherent complexity and multiscale nature. Modeling a responsive material presents a challenge with a large number of unknown variable parameters, such as chemical reactions and kinetic or conformational changes as a function of environment, which are hard to measure directly. We have recently developed a method that is parameterized based on a single set of parameters, which allows for large-scale simulations of self-assembling polyelectrolyte materials and their morphological response to the changes in salt concentration. In this talk, I will illustrate our recent progress in prediction of responsive morphologies of DNA-based micelles and gels. Our methodology permits us to construct a morphological diagram of polyelectrolyte or DNA-block copolymers and evaluate the size of aggregates obtained along with their responsive morphological transitions and scaling relations.

Plastic Attraction and Other Strange Phenomena in Active Matter
Presenter:
Alfredo Alexander-Katz (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Interactions between particles or particles and external fields lie at the core of our understanding of materials. In this talk we will present our work on emergent ultra-long-range attraction between active-colloids in dense passive-media. This long range interaction, depends on the elasticity of the system and cooperative-yielding events. Interestingly, the interaction range can be tuned, modified or completely suppressed by utilizing space and time dependent activity protocols. Another interesting system is when one of the species is pinned. In such a scenario, we find that spinning active particles undergo a disorder-induced delocalization transition. Under some particular circumstances, one finds super diffusive states in highly disordered systems, indicating that underlying correlations of the particles may play a critical role in the dynamics of such particles. These results clarify the origin of phase separation in active matter systems and give insight into new avenues that can be explored in such systems.

Organizer(s):
Clement Surville (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
Track(s):
Physics
Astrophysical flows are a great challenge for today's simulation community. Astrophysical disks in particular exhibit large Mach numbers, turbulence, ionization, shock waves and are subject to many nonlinear instabilities. Compared to geophysical and laboratory flows, a lot of improvements have been made during the last decades to the numerical methods used in this field. Finite volume methods, mesh refinement, moving mesh and other recent developments such as Lagrangian methods that improve on conventional particle-based methods (SPH) are used with efficiency; today's large supercomputers also allow one to run long term 3D calculations that were unfeasible ten years ago. The results of these simulations give a new picture of the dynamics of these disks, and contribute significantly to the astrophysics. Planet formation models are improved, disk observations can be predicted and understood, new instabilities are discovered, and much more will be done in the coming years.
We present in this minisymposium some recent developments in the field, presented by code developers and expert users. We will focus in particular on: (i) different state-of-the-art solvers for the fluid equations of a single fluid component and (ii) methods that handle the solution for coupled two or more fluids to model dust species and gas simultaneously. The efforts and interest in the field make it now possible to perform astrophysical disk simulations on almost 100 thousand CPU cores as well as on GPU clusters. It is becoming a new area of HPC in astrophysics.

The Code RoSSBi: A Multi-Fluid Method for Dust Dynamics in Protoplanetary Disks
Presenter:
Clement Surville (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
The dynamics of solids like dust and pebbles has a strong impact on the evolution of protoplanetary disks. Different instabilities develop under the effect of the drag between the gas and the solids, as for example the streaming instability. I will present the code RoSSBi, a new method designed to study this coupled dynamics, and show how well dust dynamics can be followed using a multi-fluid approach. In presence of large scale vortices, or a super Earth planet orbiting in the disk, a new form of drag instability is sustained and forms dust loaded turbulent rings. These high-density rings are very likely to form the primordial building blocks of planets.

A Restrictive Refinement Strategy for PPM Applied to Disk Simulations
Presenter:
Paul R. Woodward (University of Minnesota, United States of America)
+ Abstract
An AMR strategy that restricts the grid to just 3 levels of refinement in our PPM code for use in simulating gas dynamic flows in both stars and disks will be described. The limitation to 3 grid levels contains the potential computational load imbalances between equal-volume subdomains of a problem to a factor of 256. Modern many-core CPU or GPU nodes permit this imbalance to be handled fairly easily at a node by the number of threads assigned to each subdomain update. By exploiting the rough symmetry of disk and star problems, we address the overlapping of communication and computation by dividing the subdomains into 2 populations that are updated in an alternating sequence, with a few special subdomains updated (redundantly) along with each population. The relatively large number of subdomains with few or no fine grid cells are preferentially moved around the machine to balance loads on nodes.

Hydro-Dynamic Stability of Radially and Vertically Stratified Disks
Presenter:
Hubert Klahr (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Germany)
+ Abstract
Keplerian disks have proven to be extremely stable to perturbations – when magnetic fields are not in operation. But disks around young stars are complicated entities – they share a lot of properties with planetary atmospheres. One can learn a lot from the stability of rotating stars. Disks around young stars have a radial temperature gradient driven by stellar irradiation, which leads to a thermal wind, e.g. vertical shear. In addition, the temperature gradient leads to a height dependent radial stratification that can be radially buoyant. Without thermal relaxation these disks are linearly stable, but with the right amount of cooling and heating, for instance by the radiative transport of heat, one can drive a Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke Instability (see for instance Nelson et al. 2013) and a Convective Overstability (Klahr and Hubbard 2014; Lyra 2014). In this talk I discuss some recent results from linear stability analysis and numerical experiments.

High Order Numerical Schemes for Computational Fluid Dynamics in Astrophysics
Presenter:
Maria Veiga (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
The early stages of planet formation are generally hard to model numerically. One of the challenges for the study of proto-planetary disks is due to numerical diffusion and naive modeling assumptions. We study different high order numerical schemes, including Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods and Residual Distribution (RD) methods, and their well balanced properties. DG methods are a class of methods which can approximate the solution of a PDE while not requiring communications beyond neighboring cells to reach higher order, as opposed to traditional Finite Volume Methods (FVM). This is a very interesting property for parallelization as it minimizes the cost of communication. In addition, DG methods also have attractive properties such as the conservation of mass, momentum, energy and also angular momentum, which are relevant when modeling typical problems in astrophysics, such as planetary formation.

Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
Current and future computing systems are becoming increasingly unreliable and unpredictable: It is expected that at scale, errors will become the rule rather than the exception, and already today, severe performance fluctuations can be observed. In addition, the heterogeneity of the hardware mandates robustness, asynchrony, and communication-avoiding to be built directly into the methods, in order to achieve close to peak performance. Consequently, reliability and robustness must be built directly into scientific computing applications and numerical algorithms. In this minisymposium, we discuss the state of the art in fault-tolerant, communication-avoiding and asynchronous methods, focusing on, but not necessarily limiting the scope to, iterative solvers. The invited talks emphasize proven or provable novel algorithms and mathematical techniques beyond redundancy. Recent developments towards interactions with middleware and operating systems, as well as analytical or parameterised models, will also be highlighted. This workshop, a synthesis of the state of the field, will be accessible to non-experts and experts alike.

Resilient Constructs for Parallel Applications
Presenter:
George Bosilca (University of Tennessee, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Over the last few years, the question of resilience evolved from "will there be a need for resilience" toward a more pragmatic version asking how often the fault will impact the outcome of the application. In all cases, such an approach assumes that detection and recovery constructs are available either in the programming paradigm or at the system level, guaranteeing a complete protection of the application and its data. This talk will highlight available techniques to survive faults, their expect costs at scale, as well as present more application-driven approaches and the necessary support from the programming paradigms and their runtimes.

Fault Detection and Mitigation for Multigrid Solvers
Presenter:
Dominik Göddeke (University of Stuttgart, Germany)
+ Abstract
We present techniques to detect and repair hard and soft faults in multigrid schemes. For hard faults, we exploit the multigrid hierarchy to generate exponentially smaller checkpoints and demonstrate that restarting from coarse approximations only mildly degrades convergence. The approach is automatically applicable in asynchronous settings. For soft faults, we use ideas from classical algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) and nonlinear multigrid to derive indicators for fault detection that even work if only a single multigrid cycle is performed. Numerical results indicate a near-optimal tradeoff between overhead and robustness for a wide range of standard test problems.

Urgency and Progress in Application Level Fault Tolerance
Presenter:
Michael A. Heroux (Sandia National Laboratories, United States of America)
+ Abstract
The relationship between computer system reliability and application resilience is nuanced. Most of our scientific application base requires the practical equivalent of a reliable, digital computer. Therefore, computer system vendors will strive to deliver this kind of platform, knowing that users are unprepared for faults. At the same time, preserving reliability is becoming increasingly expensive, in system engineering costs, schedule delays and adoption of the latest component parts. Algorithmic and software preparations are urgently needed so that future applications are more resilient to failure, enabling computer system developers to relax their constraints. In this presentation, we provide abstract frameworks for resilient algorithms and show progress on the local-failure, local-recovery model for single-program, multiple-data (SPMD) applications. We also discuss the opportunities for addressing resilience as we move toward task-based execution environments, where new approaches to resilience become possible.

Resilience Enhancement Using Discrete A Priori Bounds for the Detection of Faulty PDE Solutions
Presenter:
Paul Mycek (CERFACS, France)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Resilience represents one of the many challenges to be anticipated and addressed before viable exascale systems can emerge. In this context, we focus on the problem of resilience to silent data corruption (SDC) in elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) solvers. We derive a priori bounds for the discrete solution of second-order elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). The bounds are then incorporated into a task-based domain decomposition framework, in order to verify the admissibility of local (i.e., at the subdomain level) PDE solutions. We demonstrate that these a priori bounds are able to detect most of system faults, and thus considerably enhance the resilience and the overall performance of the solver.

Track(s):
Emerging Domains in HPC, Life Sciences
The predictive power of fluid-structure interaction methods together with the growing computational power of massively parallel supercomputing architectures have led to key scientific and technological advances in patient-specific hemodynamic modeling. The increase in computational power alongside improved numerical techniques open up the possibility to simulate and predict behavior from the cellular to systemic level over larger temporal domains. The aim of the present minisymposium is to gather experts in the computational hemodynamics community to discuss the challenges in algorithmic development as well as porting, scaling, and optimizing large-scale blood flow models for leadership class systems. The presentations will focus on both the discussion of findings and the lessons learned regarding effective use of next generation architectures for the advancement of such biomedical applications.

Measuring the Ankle-Brachial Index with Massively Parallel Simulations
Presenter:
Amanda Randles (Duke University, United States of America)
+ Abstract
The ankle-brachial index (ABI), relating arterial blood pressure in the upper arm and ankle, is used to diagnose peripheral arterial disease. Computational simulations of ABI have the potential to determine the parameters which produce an abnormal or ischemic ABI. While zero- and one-dimensional schemes to compute ABI exist, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations are capable of higher simulation fidelity and can incorporate patient-derived imaging data. We introduce highly parallelized and scalable methods for generating the simulation domain of the full arterial system and efficiently distributing the computational load among 1.6 million tasks. We conduct simulations of flow in a full arterial system and demonstrate adequate numerical convergence for ABI at 50μm simulation resolution. We study the dependence of ABI on stenoses by modifying the arterial geometry. Further, by incorporating gravity as an external force, we consider the influence of body posture on ABI.

Performance Analysis of Parallel Lattice Boltzmann Methods on Complex Domains
Presenter:
Christian Godenschwager (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany)
+ Abstract
The waLBerla software framework provides efficient parallel methods that can be used to simulate flows on adaptive meshes in complex domains. It is thus well suited for flow scenarios as they arise in hemodynamics. In biomedical applications both strong and weak scalability are important. We will discuss data structures, algorithms, and novel software techniques based on automatic program transformations that additionally help to achieve excellent in-core and intra-node performance.

Numerical Lab-On-a-Chip: High-Throughput Simulation and Optimization of Microfluidic Devices
Presenter:
Dmitry Alexeev (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
Microfluidic devices, such as lab-on-a-chip, transport and manipulate nanoliter quantities of fluids to perform tasks like blood separation and detection of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). However, fast computer aided design of the chips remains a formidable task due to the complexity and scale of involved processes. We present uDeviceX (ACM Gordon Bell Prize Finalist 2015), a high-throughput software designed for accurate simulations of microconfined blood flows at large scales using state-of-the art DPD (Dissipative Particle Dynamics) models. Targeted and carefully optimized for GPU-enabled supercomputers, uDeviceX is capable of unprecedented simulations of blood flows at sub-micron resolution in realistic microfluidic geometries. Following recent experimental studies, we have built and tested a virtual microfluidic device that separates RBCs from WBCs and CTCs in the high-hematocrit solution using the Deterministic Lateral Displacement principle. Moreover, the fast time-to-solution allowed us to computationally optimize design of the device and achieve enhanced filtering speed and purity.

Fully Coupled Fluid-Electro-Mechanical Cardiac Problems
Presenter:
Jazmin Aguado (Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain)
+ Abstract
In this work, we present a fully coupled fluid-electro-mechanical cardiac simulation amenable to be used in parallel computers. The coupled 3-field problem is solved using Alya, which is the in-house BSC's parallel multi-physics simulation code. The examples we show are done on a biventricular geometry to study the effect of transcatheter medical devices implanted in the cardiac cavities in the flow around them. The problems are large enough to be solved in parallel computers, the scalability of the fully-coupled algorithm being a decisive issue. Therefore, we explain details of the parallel implementation of the code not only for the individual problems but also for the coupling schemes, which includes an interface quasi-Newton scheme specifically designed for efficient parallel runs in large-scale cases.
MS42 Earth System Modeling: HPC Bringing Together Weather and Climate Prediction , Room A
Organizer(s):
Joachim Biercamp (German Climate Computing Centre, Germany)
Track(s):
Climate & Weather
Numerical weather prediction and climate modeling are highly dependent on the available computing power in terms of the achievable spatial resolution, the number of members run in ensemble simulations as well as the completeness of physical processes that can be represented. Both domains are also highly dependent on the ability to produce, store and analyze large amounts of simulated data, often with time constraints from operational schedules or international coordinated experiments. The ever increasing complexity of both numerical models and high-performance computing (HPC) systems has led to the situation that today, one major limiting factor is no longer the theoretical peak performance of available HPC systems, but the relatively low sustained efficiency that can be obtained with complex numerical models of the Earth system. The differences in model complexity, as well as the temporal and spatial scales that were historically characteristic for climate and weather modeling, are vanishing since both applications ultimately require complex Earth system modeling capabilities which resolve the same physical process detail across atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere. With increasing compute power and data handling needs, both communities must exploit synergies to tackle common scientific and technical challenges.
This minisymposium will focus on joint climate and weather community engagement in cutting edge high-resolution modeling for research and service provision.

ESiWACE: The Center of Excellence in Simulation of Climate and Weather in Europe
Presenter:
Joachim Biercamp (German Climate Computing Centre, Germany)
+ Abstract
A particular challenge for weather and climate simulation is comprehensive global models with spatial resolutions that allow simulating convective clouds and small-scale ocean eddies. These simulations would produce better predictions of trends and provide much more fidelity in the representation of high-impact regional events. However, running such models in operational mode clearly require exascale computing and data handling capability. We will discuss the ESiWACE initiative and relate it to work in progress on high-resolution simulations in Europe. We present strong scalability measurements to demonstrate current computability in weather and climate simulation. Special focus is on the Icosahedal Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model used for high-resolution global and regional simulations. We demonstrate that close-to-optimal parallel efficiency can be achieved in strong scaling global experiments, e.g. 94% for 5km resolution using 36k cores. Based on scalability and high-resolution experiments we extrapolate future capabilities for ICON expected for weather and climate research at exascale.

High Resolution Simulations with the Weather Forecast Model ICON: Teaming Up Modeling and Measuring Communities in Climate and Weather Research
Presenter:
Daniel Klocke (DWD, Germany)
+ Abstract
High resolution simulation in support of measurement campaigns offers a promising and emerging way to create large-scale context for small-scale observations of clouds and precipitation processes. As these simulations include the coupling of measured small-scale processes with the circulation, they also help to integrate the research communities from modeling and observations and allow for detailed model evaluations against dedicated observations. In connection with the measurement campaign NARVAL (August 2016 and December 2013) convection permitting simulations for the tropical Atlantic, with local refinement to 1.2 km for the western part of the domain, were performed using the icosahedral non-hydrostatic (ICON) model. These simulations are again used to drive large eddy resolving simulations with the same model for selected days. The simulations are presented with the focus on the benefit for scientific communities doing atmospheric measurements and numerical modeling of climate and weather.

IS-ENES Coupling Technology Benchmarks
Presenter:
Sophie Valcke (CERFACS, France)
+ Abstract
Within the European IS-ENES2 project we are developing coupling technology benchmarks based on simplified model components which capture the essence of the coupling without the complexities of the science. Today, five simple coupled configurations are available for testing. The components of these configurations run on regular latitude-longitude grids with up to 3000x3000 grid points. All configurations implement the same coupling algorithm (i.e. fields are sent back and forth between the components) using either the OASIS3-MCT, OpenPALM, ESMF, MCT only or YAC coupling technologies. The time for the coupling initialization and for the coupling exchanges was measured for the configurations running with up to O(10000) cores on three different platforms: Bullx at CINES in France, Cray XC40 at the UK Met Office, and the Broadwell partition of Marconi at CINECA in Italy. These results and lessons learned from this first benchmark experience will be discussed and future plans will be presented.

How to Escape from the Data Avalanche of High-Resolution Climate Models?
Presenter:
Christoph Schär (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
There are large efforts towards refining the horizontal resolution of climate models to O(1 km) with the intent to represent convective clouds explicitly rather than using semi-empirical parameterizations. This refinement would move the governing equations closer to first principles and is expected to reduce the uncertainties of climate models. However, the output volume of climate simulations would dramatically grow, and storing it for later analysis would likely become impractical, due to limited I/O bandwidth and mass-storage capacity. In this presentation we discuss possible solutions to this challenge. Key elements of the proposed strategy are the exploitation of online analysis in combination with rerunning the simulation, as well as the use of bit-reproducible codes and a data virtualization layer. The work is based on an ongoing project that uses a GPU-enabled version of the COSMO model as a regional climate model at 2.2 km resolution on a European domain.
MS43 High-Throughput Computing on Emerging HPC Platforms for Particle Detectors at The Large Hadron Collider (2/2): Simulation and Data Analytics , Room B2
Organizer(s):

Track(s):
Physics
Understanding the basic building blocks of matter is amongst the most formidable ventures humanity has undertaken. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its associated experiments have allowed us to observe the particles and processes that lie at the foundation of our current understanding of the physical world. Furthermore, the LHC and other high-energy physics (HEP) facilities continue to produce data at an ever increasing rate, allowing us to peer beyond the Standard Model. In order to filter, process, and analyze the data captured at particle detectors, the HEP community has had over the last decades an insatiable appetite for computing power. Today the LHC experiments record around 150 PB/year. The rate of interactions to be studied will increase by a factor of 100 in the next 10 to 15 years. Computing at the LHC experiments happens mostly in two domains. In Online Computing, data captured at the detector must be processed and filtered using near-realtime, high-throughput computing software frameworks. The reconstruction of a particle collision event employs a large number of complex algorithms before the results are stored for further analysis. Offline computing deals with the physics analysis of the large data sets captured by the detector and retained by the online computing software. In this session we take a closer look at detector simulation and data analysis in HEP experiments. Much work has been devoted in recent years to further develop the existing software frameworks to better take advantage of modern hardware architectures. This includes shared-memory parallelism, vectorization and support for coprocessors and accelerators. Furthermore, the recent advancements in the field of machine learning are finding a number of applications in high-energy physics. The presentations discuss these simulation and data-analysis frameworks in the context of high-performance computing and modern hardware architectures.

GeantV: Designing the Future of Particle Transport Simulation for HEP
Presenter:
Sofia Vallecorsa (CERN, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Approximately half of today’s LHC Grid computing power budget is used for detector simulation. The current code, GEANT4, shows suboptimal performance on modern SIMD architectures. A new version, called GEANTV, is being developed to improve the physics accuracy, while preserving, at the same, portability through different architectures (Xeon Phi, GPU). Introducing fine grained parallelism, vectorisation, efficient memory management and NUMA awareness, we achieve considerable speedup with respect to current GEANT4 and a good scalability through a large number of threads. Furthermore, we will present preliminary results on a new machine-learning based approach for fast detector simulation. This new development, within the GEANTV framework, is intended to address the ever increasing need for simulated events expected for LHC experiments and their upgrades, such as the High Luminosity LHC.

Stitched the Multi-Threaded CMS Framework: Strategy and Performance on HPC Platforms
Presenter:
Vincenzo Innocente (CERN, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Simulation and Data processing in High Energy Physics is blessed by natural parallelism at many levels of granularity: down to single particle in the case of Detector Simulation. This has allowed it to exploit farm parallelization as long as memory per core was abundant. This came with the cost of a poor usage of SIMD and SIMT architectures as farm parallelization is intrinsically incoherent. In this presentation, we will discuss the evolution of the software framework of the CMS experiment to adapt to HPC platforms where memory per core is scarce and where exploiting SIMD and SIMT is essential to leverage the full computing power available.
MS44 Modeling, Computational Methods and Applications of Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography , Villa Ciani, Room 205
Organizer(s):
Martin Frank (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
Track(s):
Emerging Domains in HPC, Life Sciences
Fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) is an optical imaging technique to access the three-dimensional distribution of a fluorescent in a few centimeters depth. The main application is for preclinical drug development, but the technology is also potentially applicable for human hand and breast imaging. In FMT, a light source shines onto the object and the light propagates into the object, where it scatters and is absorbed. It triggers a fluorescent material, which emits light at a different wavelength. The remaining light and the emitted light can be measured on the other side of the object. From the measurements, the fluorescence distribution should be reconstructed as accurately as possible. This is not only a relevant medical problem but also leads to a current topic of mathematical research. One important aspect is an accurate optical model containing information about the shape and heterogeneous scattering and absorption maps. Mathematically, the process can be described by the Boltzmann transport equation, which itself is expensive to solve. Furthermore, due to the high scattering in the near-infrared wavelengths, the inverse problem of fluorescence reconstruction is a mathematically and computationally challenging problem, requiring HPC.  The purpose of this minisymposium is to report on the continuing progress on mathematical and computational methods that aim at an improvement of the quality of the FMT image reconstruction. It brings together researchers from applied mathematics, computational science, as well as industry to discuss their work and exchange ideas.

Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography in Pharmacology Research
Presenter:
Felix Gremse (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
+ Abstract
Fluorescent-mediated tomography (FMT) can provide quantitative in-vivo assessment of fluorescent-labeled probes, therefore allowing for many preclinical applications in pharmacological research. In a study investigating the impact of tumor microenvironment on tumor invasion, a significantly higher matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-activity, indication of tumor invasion, was detected in-vivo in late-stage tumors compared to intermediate- and early-stage tumors. Moreover, significantly reduced MMP-activity was monitored post sunitinib-treatment. All in-vivo findings were confirmed by ex-vivo immunohistochemistry analysis. µCT-FMT was applied in another study to assess elimination routes and organ bio-distribution of various fluorescent model drugs and drug-delivery systems. ICG demonstrated hepatobiliary elimination and complete clearance from the body at 48h. NanoGels showed similar but slower hepatobiliary elimination due to size-dependent degradation. OsteoSense was strongly located in bones and rapidly cleared renally and MicroBubbles showed the longest retention in liver and spleen and low signal in the kidneys likely caused by fragment-retention.

Improving Resolution and Sensitivity of Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography using GPU-Accelerated Image Reconstruction
Presenter:
Felix Gremse (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
+ Abstract
Fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) enables non-invasive three-dimensional assessment of the near-infrared fluorescence distribution in human body parts or small laboratory animals. The combination with micro-computed tomography (µCT) provides anatomical information, enabling improved reconstruction and analysis. Fluorescence reconstruction involves solving a dense least squares system, whose explicit representation requires large amounts of memory, limiting the achievable resolution in practice. We propose an implicit representation where the matrix-vector product is computed using GPU-accelerated adjoint algorithmic differentiation, reducing memory requirements and allowing higher resolution reconstructions. The least squares problem is minimized using the Multiplicative Updates method, which constrains the minimization to non-negative solutions. Phantom measurements show that the non-negativity constraints are essential for fluorescence reconstruction. µCT-FMT in vivo experiments with rectal insertions containing fluorescence and CT contrast agent show that the implicit version achieves better signal localization compared to an explicit version.

Accelerated Image Reconstruction Algorithms in Fluorescence Optical Tomography
Presenter:
Herbert Egger (TU Darmstadt, Germany)
+ Abstract
Fluorescence optical tomography is a non-destructive imaging modality that aims at recovering the distribution of a fluorophore inside an object by measurement of emitted light intensities for multiple illuminations. The goal of this talk is to present strategies to efficiently handle the huge amount of recorded data in the computational image reconstruction by appropriate reduction while at the same time keeping the full resolution of the method.

On Inexact Geometry Treatment in Fluorescence Molecular Tomography
Presenter:
Matthias Schlottbom (University of Twente, Netherlands)
+ Abstract
In many applications the treatment of interfaces is challenging. A particular difficulty arises if the geometry is only defined imprecisely. In this case, it is desirable to use methods which are robust and efficient. To this aim, we propose in this talk a diffuse interface method as a tool for the solution of variational inverse problems. The main idea is to replace variational integrals of the original problem by a weighted average of integrals of perturbed domains. This allows, for example, the use of structured grids in subsequent discretization procedures, which in turn might be used in the construction of very efficient methods. As a particular example of a variational regularization method, we will discuss Tikhonov regularization when applied to fluorescence optical tomography.
MS45 Recent Advances in Fault-Tolerant, Asynchronous and Communication-Avoiding Algorithms (2/2) , Room B3

Track(s):
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
Current and future computing systems are becoming increasingly unreliable and unpredictable: It is expected that at scale, errors will become the rule rather than the exception, and already today, severe performance fluctuations can be observed. In addition, the heterogeneity of the hardware mandates robustness, asynchrony, and communication-avoiding to be built directly into the methods, in order to achieve close to peak performance. Consequently, reliability and robustness must be built directly into scientific computing applications and numerical algorithms. In this minisymposium, we discuss the state of the art in fault-tolerant, communication-avoiding and asynchronous methods, focusing on, but not necessarily limiting the scope to, iterative solvers. The invited talks emphasize proven or provable novel algorithms and mathematical techniques beyond redundancy. Recent developments towards interactions with middleware and operating systems, as well as analytical or parameterised models, will also be highlighted. This workshop, a synthesis of the state of the field, will be accessible to non-experts and experts alike.

Fault-Tolerant Parallel-In-Time Integration with PFASST
Presenter:
Robert Speck (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany)
+ Abstract
For time-dependent PDEs, parallel-in-time integration using the "parallel full approximation scheme in space and time" (PFASST) is a promising way to accelerate existing space-parallel approaches beyond their scaling limits. Inspired by non-linear multigrid ideas, PFASST allows integration of multiple time-steps simultaneously. Its multigrid-in-time nature can be exploited to recover from hard faults and subsequent data loss, preventing a breakdown of the time integration process. Since PFASST stores solutions at multiple time steps on different processors, information from adjacent steps can be used to recover after a processor has failed. The multigrid hierarchy allows one to use the coarse level for correcting the reconstructed solution, which can help minimize overhead. We present various recovery strategies and sketch a theoretical model for linking the overhead to the number of additional iterations required for convergence after a fault. The efficiency of the different strategies is assessed for examples of diffusive and advective type.

Reducing Data Movement by Exploiting Computation Dependencies
Presenter:
Marc Casas (Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain)
+ Abstract
In this talk we describe techniques based on graph partitioning methods to efficiently mitigate the impact of NUMA effects on parallel applications' performance. We dynamically exploit information regarding control or data dependencies between sequential pieces of code to efficiently reduce data transfers across the whole parallel run. Our approach adds negligible overhead and is able to significantly improve the execution time of relevant OpenMP parallel codes when run on architectures with several NUMA domains and large remote memory access latencies.

Fault Tolerance with High Performance for Matrix Multiplication
Presenter:
Noam Birnbaum (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel)
+ Abstract
General-purpose hard-error resiliency solutions such as checkpoint-restart, severely degrade performance. For numerical linear algebra, efficient solutions based on distributed 2D algorithms incur lower overhead and guarantee optimal performance for minimal memory size only. Furthermore, they require significant increase in the number of processors. We obtain fault tolerant matrix multiplication algorithms that reduce resource overhead: minimizing both the number of additional processors and the communication costs. Particularly, for 2D case, we reduce the number of additional processors required from θ(sqrt(P)) to 1 (or from θ(h sqrt(P)) to h, where h is the maximum number of simultaneous faults). For larger local memories, we obtain a fault tolerant adaptation of 2.5D algorithm, significantly reducing the communication costs, with very little additional processors required. Finally, we show how to obtain resiliency for Strassen and Strassen-like algorithms, with little overhead. We demonstrate that most of our algorithms are optimal or close to being optimal.

Enlarged Krylov Subspace Methods for Reducing Communication
Presenter:
Olivier Tissot (INRIA, France)
+ Abstract
In this talk we discuss enlarged Krylov subspace methods for reducing communication when solving large sparse linear systems of equations. Those methods rely on adding at each iteration of the iterative method t vectors instead of one as in classic methods. They lead to a faster convergence and thus an important reduction in the number of global communications while increasing arithmetic intensity. We present experimental and parallel performance results that show the efficiency of the methods.

Although it seems difficult for any hardware to reach real exaflops at the moment, developments of first-principles calculation codes in this direction are still very important in the community of materials science, chemistry, and condensed matter physics. The Swiss National Computing Centre, which has the world No.8 Piz Daint (9.7 PFlops), announced that it will adopt NVIDIA Pascal GPU in conjunction with Intel Haswell CPU. On the other hand, in Japan, the Joint Center for Advanced High-Performance Computing and FUJITSU launched world No.6 Oakforest-PACS (13.5 PFlops), consisting of Intel Xeon Phi, and RIKEN, the centre of world No.7 K-computer (10.5 PFlops) by FUJITSU, announced that it will adopt ARM processors for the Post-K exascale supercomputer. Namely, there are two different directions: GPU-CPU and many-cores. In this trend, first-principle (mainly DFT) calculations codes need to be adjusted to either or both in the coding stage or the methodology. This minisymposium is designed to bring developers facing these issues in Switzerland and Japan together, and discuss the future directions with an audience from domain science and computer science.

Large Scale Electronic Structure Calculations with CP2K
Presenter:
Juerg Hutter (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
New developments in the electronic structure code CP2K have been focusing on algorithms for large-scale simulations using density functional (DFT) methods and wavefunction correlation methods. For both methods, the key to efficient massively parallel algorithm is the handling of sparse tensors. For DFT the algorithms need the evaluation of matrix functions (e.g. the matrix sign function) using as building block matrix-matrix multiplication. Wavefunction correlation methods can be cast into tensor reductions that can be mapped onto matrix multiplications. An efficient and versatile sparse matrix multiplications library is, therefore, the main building block for further developments in this field. We developed a massively parallel library (DBCSR) for sparse block matrix multiplication. The library allowed us to use high-performance computers for large-scale applications and to investigate limitations of currently algorithms and to design new algorithms for the use of the new generation of supercomputers.

NTChem: A High-performance Software Package for Quantum Chemistry Simulation
Presenter:
Takahito Nakajima (RIKEN, Japan)
+ Abstract
Quantum chemistry software comprises immensely useful tools in material and biological science research. Widely diverse programs have been developed in many countries, though Japan has lagged behind. In the early stages of the K computer project, no quantum chemistry software was available for general purpose and massively parallel computation on the K computer. Therefore, we have chosen to develop a new comprehensive ab initio quantum chemistry software: NTChem. It is a completely new software package that implements not only standard quantum chemistry approaches, but also original and improved theoretical methods that we have developed in our research work. We hope that NTChem will be an important tool leading the way toward a new frontier of computational molecular science. In this talk, I will present an overview of NTChem software and its applications.

Large-Scale Static and Dynamic Density-Functional Calculations in a Real-Space Scheme: New Physical Properties of Two-Dimensional Systems
Presenter:
Atsushi Oshiyama (University of Tokyo, Japan)
+ Abstract
To face current and future massively parallel architectures of supercomputers requires close collaboration between the fields of physical science and computer science, and one such collaboration has been established, named COMPUTICS (http://computics-material.jp/index-e.html). This collaboration has enabled us to perform static and dynamic electronic-structure calculations based on the density-functional theory (DFT) for tens-of-thousands of atom systems. The scheme we have adopted is the real-space (RS) scheme. We will describe how we are able to perform such large-scale computations efficiently in this RSDFT scheme and report the electronic properties obtained by the RSDFT calculations performed for two-dimensional systems such as bilayer graphene, silicene on substrates, and atomic steps on semiconductor surfaces.

BigDFT: Accurate and Efficient Density Functional Calculations on Peta Scale Computers
Presenter:
Stefan Goedecker (University of Basel, Switzerland)
+ Abstract
BigDFT is a density functional code using a Daubechies wavelet basis set. Wavelets combine the advantages of plane waves and Gaussians. Being a systematic basis set they allow us to obtain the exact solution within the chosen model (i.e., exchange correlation functional and pseudopotential). Their real space localization makes it possible to reduce the number of basis functions for open systems compared to plane waves. The BigDFT code is based on a very efficient combined MPI/OpenMP parallelization scheme. In addition large parts of the code can be performed on GPU hardware. This is in particular the case for the Poisson solver which in turn allows to do exact hybrid functional calculations at unprecedented speed. Various results concerning the accuracy and speed will be presented.
MS47 Updating the Lagrangian-Eulerian Debate , Room E
Organizer(s):
Paul R. Woodward (University of Minnesota, United States of America)
Track(s):
Physics, Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
In the early days of HPC, a debate raged between the Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches to hydrodynamic simulations. In 1D, there was no contest: Lagrangian hydrodynamics was the clear winner. This approach is still seen today in stellar evolution codes, where the immense time spans that must be covered forces us to traverse at least the great bulk of that time span in 1D. In the 1960s and 70s, the debate moved to 2D. Lagrangian grids tangle, which gave rise to various mitigating techniques, such as slide lines and “free Lagrange” or “continuous rezoning” approaches. Eulerian grids cannot easily capture critical flow features, such as multimaterial surfaces, which gave rise to mitigating techniques, such as volume-of-fluid and front tracking approaches. In the 1980s, the seeds of modern SPH (smooth particle hydrodynamics) and AMR (adaptive mesh refinement) were planted in the Lagrangian and Eulerian camps, respectively. The simulation community then moved to 3D, where these new variants now play very important roles. In this minisymposium, we will explore the present state of the art on both the Lagrangian and Eulerian sides. For example, can Riemann problems play a similar role for improving shock capturing in Lagrangian codes that they play in Eulerian ones? Or viewing the debate from another angle, how dynamic can an AMR grid actually be at an affordable overhead cost? A potential outcome of the discussion in this minisymposium could be a small selection of test problems that could, in principle, be addressed by both approaches. Problems along the lines of “I bet you can’t do this” would be fun, but only if they actually could be set up in the opposite approach without huge investments of time and effort. Problems that have been addressed in both ways in recent years that would be of interest to hear about in their present states of the art include: the common envelope star problem, formation of galaxies or other large structures in cosmology, the star formation and fragmentation, or planet formation, problem, or any of a variety of problems involving unstable multifluid interfaces and the development of turbulence. Contributions showing the state of the art in these domains will be presented from the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives. Contributors will demonstrate the potential for their favorite problems to become selected tests that could be used by the community in advancing this debate, and with that the level of technical proficiency on each side. This minisymposium is viewed as a mechanism to begin this debate afresh from a modern perspective. The selected presenters will engage the attendees, particularly with a goal of establishing a forum and a set of agreed upon test problems.
13:30 - 14:00
Using Constrained, High-Order Subgrid Structure to Address Interaction of Turbulence with Unstable Multi-Fluid Interfaces in Uniform-Grid Eulerian Simulations
Presenter:
Paul R. Woodward (University of Minnesota, United States of America)
+ Abstract
Researchers wishing to simulate multifluid flows whose dynamics are dominated by the nonlinear behavior of unstable multifluid interfaces have struggled to enjoy the benefits of a Lagrangian treatment within an Eulerian code. I am using constrained PPB advection for this purpose. I will describe this technique briefly, and then introduce two well-studied test problems that can be used in future code comparison studies to assess the costs and benefits of this and other approaches. The first test is an idealized inertial confinement fusion (ICF) problem and the second is the entrainment of stably stratified gas in a stellar interior at the top of a turbulent convection zone. Both of these problems have been “solved” using Eulerian PPB advection in a PPM gas dynamics context with fine, uniform grids of up to a trillion cells. Materials will be made available on-line for interested researchers to try their hand at these problems.
14:00 - 14:30
Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics: Methods and Astrophysical Applications
Presenter:
Thomas Quinn (University of Washington, United States of America)
+ Abstract
The strengths of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) include low advection errors, the handling of arbitrary geometries and free surfaces, and naturally adapting to large density contrasts. These strengths, combined with its natural unification with the N-body techniques used for self-gravitating systems made SPH a common technique for numerical hydrodynamics in astrophysics. In the mid 2000s it became generally known that the commonly used SPH algorithms suppressed the growth of instabilities and gas mixing at phase boundaries. Since then, a number of improvements have been made to SPH algorithms to address these and other issues. Even with these improvements, SPH is still more diffusive and slower to converge than other methods, but ongoing algorithm development continues to address these shortcomings. These advantages and challenges will be discussed and illustrated with the problem of the dissolution of a cold cloud moving through a hot medium, and the modeling of protoplanetary disks.
14:30 - 15:00
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Hydrodynamics: Recent Development and Test Problems
Presenter:
Gabriel Rockefeller (Los Alamos National Laboratory, United States of America)
+ Abstract
+ Presentation
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods for multimaterial, multiphysics simulation attempt to combine the material-modeling strengths of Lagrangian techniques with flexible, robust strategies for advection and other mesh optimizations. The Lagrangian Applications Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory develops the FLAG ALE radiation hydrodynamics code, including staggered-grid and cell-centered hydrodynamics, radiation diffusion, magnetohydrodynamics, and a wide variety of material models, on unstructured meshes that support relaxation, remapping, reconnection, and slide surfaces. I will review recent work on ALE methods and propose (or revisit) test problems of interest.

IP05 Towards Quantum High Performance Computing
Presenter:
Matthias Troyer (Microsoft Research, United States of America)
+ Abstract
+ Biography
A century after the development of quantum mechanics we have now reached an exciting time where computational devices that make use of quantum effects can be built. Quantum random number generators, analog quantum simulators and quantum annealers are already commercially available and work on quantum computers is accelerating. First demonstration quantum computers exist today and devices with computational powers beyond that of any imaginable classical computers seem just over the horizon and feasible within the next few years. Following an introduction to the exceptional computational power of quantum computers using analogies with classical high performance computing systems, I will discuss real-world application problems that can be tackled on medium scale quantum computers but not on post exa-scale classical computers. I will motivate hardware software co-design of quantum accelerators to classical supercomputers and the need for educating a new generation of quantum software engineers with knowledge both in quantum computing and in high performance computing.

This talk reports efforts on refactoring and optimizing the climate and weather forecasting programs \u2013 CAM and WRF \u2013 on Sunway TaihuLight. To map the large code base to the millions of cores on the Sunway system, OpenACC-based refactoring was taken as the major approach, with source-to-source translator tools applied to exploit the most suitable parallelism for the CPE cluster and to fit the intermediate variable into the limited on-chip fast buffer. For individual kernels, when comparing the original ported version using only MPEs and the refactored version using both the MPE and CPE clusters, we achieve up to 22x speedup for the compute-intensive kernels.

However, the exuberant scale of the problem reaching 10^12 degrees of freedom, as well as the multi-scale complexity of the underlying parameter space render seismic applications as some of the most challenging HPC problems in the physical sciences. This is particularly the case for the inverse problem in mapping observations to parameters using millions of observations. Technical bottlenecks arise on many ends: meshing complex geological 3D structures, scalability, adaptivity to emerging architectures, data infrastructure for millions of simulations, provenance, code usability. <br /><br />In this minisymposium, we will hear about a diverse range of topics covering state-of-the-art wave propagation at scales between the globe and the human body, each with specifically adaptive techniques and their HPC solutions. Many of the talks will be based on different variants of the spectral-element technique, which has been dominating large-scale seismology for the past two decades. Novel variants include its scalable adaptation to tetrahedra, a new flexible implementation in C++, coupling to pseudo-spectral approaches, and scaling on emerging architectures. Other techniques will be the discontinuous Galerkin method for dynamic earthquake rupture, and an immersive approach to couple numerical modeling with wave tank experiments on FPGAs. <br /><br />Many of the talks will be driven by requirements from specific applications such as nonlinear earthquake rupture dynamics in a complex 3D geological fault system, multiscale geological structures at scales reaching the deep Earth interior, wave tank experiments, seismic tomography at large and industrial scales, and an application to breast cancer detection using ultrasound. <br /><br />In the discussion, we will strive to identify common bottlenecks, ideas to adapt to emerging architectures, any possible basic set of common algorithmic solutions, and discuss where one could move forward to consolidate different approaches based on any commonalities such as meshing, MPI-approaches, data infrastructures, or numerical solvers.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa261"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:00 - 13:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

These characteristics are crucial for science and engineering-driven applications making use of exascale computing like geophysics, astrophysics, aerodynamics, etc. Algorithms in high-performance computing require a rethinking of the standard approaches to ensure on the one hand the full usage of the future computing power, and on the other hand energy-efficiency. A careful implementation of all performance-relevant parts and an intelligent combination with external libraries is fundamental for exascale computation. Multigrid and domain decomposition play an important role in many scientific applications and have often developed ideas separately using the immense compute power of supercomputers.

On one hand, conventional fossil fuel resources such as oil, natural gas, and coal are limited and dwindling. On the other hand, the emissions due to combustion of fossil fuels evidently impact the chemical composition of our atmosphere, leading to adverse effects on the climate and environment. These inevitable global challenges imminently demand for technological advances in energy conversion, storage and transport. The search for novel materials for energy applications has recently become an extremely active area of research worldwide to address these issues, with efforts in chemistry, solid-state physics, and materials science, via the Materials Genome Initiative in the US and related initiatives in other countries. In this search, computational tools are being actively developed not only to explore uncharted chemical space of new materials, but also to understand the complex interplay of materials properties with the underlying crystal structures.<br /><br />One particular class of materials for energy applications are thermoelectric materials, which are required to drive thermoelectric generators that allow for a reliable, clean, emission-free conversion of (waste) heat into electricity. Until the mid-1990s, thermoelectrics had been considered inefficient and not economically relevant, but with enhanced structural engineering and intense research on novel complex materials the interest for thermoelectric materials has been recently revived. The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is governed by the so-called figure of merit zT, which is maximized by increasing the thermopower and electrical conductivity while reducing the thermal conductivity. These materials properties are however strongly interrelated, e.g. in most materials the thermal and electrical conductivities correlate with each other through the Wiedemann-Franz-law. Hence, the search for a material with a maximal zT poses a non-trivial materials design challenge.<br /><br />This symposium aims at bringing together scientists to share their computational efforts in thermoelectric materials development. An accurate description of the bulk lattice thermal transport, which is governed by phonon-phonon interactions, demands advanced simulation techniques and large HPC infrastructures. Solving the Boltzmann phonon transport equation requires the knowledge of the anharmonic energy contributions which give rise to phonon scattering, posing one of the computationally most demanding aspects in modeling thermal resistivity. Density functional perturbation theory and finite difference methods are currently state-of-the-art approaches, but remain computationally highly demanding. Furthermore, the interactions of phonons with electrons become increasingly important at elevated temperatures and have recently been the focus of research in thermoelectric materials. Finally, methods for modeling of transport properties on a large scale are required for the discovery of new materials with improved thermoelectric properties. The focus of this symposium will be on novel approaches, amongst others based on methods from machine learning, signal processing, and high-throughput techniques, in modeling transport properties to advance in silico discovery of thermoelectric materials.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa275"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:00 - 13:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

We introduce a phonon open database (http://phonondb.mtl.kyoto-u.ac.jp), that we are making and hosting. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess167-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess167" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>MS05 Higher Order Discretizations in Large Eddy Simulation of High Reynolds Number Turbulent Flow in Engineering Applications</strong>, Room E</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right"> <g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess167"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="table organizer-items session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Organizer(s):</div> <div class="td"> <div class="organizers inline"> <div class="author"> Ramesh Balakrishnan (Argonne National Laboratory, United States of America)</span> <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

The advances in computing hardware notwithstanding, it is becoming clear that large eddy simulation (LES) of such flows, where the resolved/filtered scales of motion are evolved, and the unresolved scaled are modeled, is still intractable. The large number of grid points required for a well-resolved simulation of the flow physics places a greater need for modeling the unresolved scales and evolving the resolved scales in a manner whereby the dissipative and dispersive errors are minimized. Given that in a LES, the errors in the solution are a combination of filtering errors that are characterized by the filter width (delta), the numerical order of accuracy, which is characterized by the cell width (h), and the sub-grid scale (SGS) modeling error, an assessment of the resulting &ldquo;solution&rdquo; is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to isolate the effects of each of these contributing factors. This area of research offers opportunities to quantify the tradeoffs between the computational advantages offered by higher-order numerical methods and the turbulence resolving capabilities of these numerical methods in the context of LES of high Reynolds number flows. On emerging exascale computing platforms, where the available power is capped at 20MW, the architecture is beginning to be characterized by processors with a large number of cores that run at dynamic clock speeds that decrease as the cores begin to overheat, deep memory hierarchies with less on-chip memory, and multiple pathways to parallelizing algorithms, ranging from coarse-grained parallelism (MPI) to fine-grained parallelism (threads, vectorization). The reduced on-chip memory requires time consuming operations to fetch data from external (off-chip) memory to local cache in order to make computations possible! On such platforms, the traditional measure of assessing the efficiency of parallel codes, via FLOPs alone, is being replaced by the more meaningful arithmetic intensity (AI), which is defined as the ratio of FLOPs to the number of load-store operations. For turbulence simulations, it would appear that higher-order numerical methods that are less memory bandwidth limited may offer an obvious advantage. However, despite a veritable body of literature that documents the advantages of higher-order methods when applied to problems that are ideal &ndash; in the sense that the cases to which they have been applied are those where one has a fairly high degree of control on the inflow and boundary conditions, and the geometry of the computational domain &ndash; it is not quite clear if these methods could serve as the gold standard when one applies higher-order methods to drive the compute engine in a predictive flow simulation tool, with considerable uncertainties in the flow conditions and complexities in the geometry. The focus of this minisymposium, therefore, is a presentation of higher-order numerical discretizations, their impacts on the resolvable turbulent flow physics, and the scaling and parallel performance of higher-order discretizations on emerging computing hardware.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa126"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:00 - 13:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Application codes that want to take advantage of such systems need to reshape to achieve good levels of performance. At the same time, it is important to ensure that codes can be maintained and developed further without undue complexity imposed by the execution systems. Moreover, significant advances in the field of reconfigurable computing and their system integration have generated major interest: new generations provide highly efficient FP units, and fast cache-coherent interconnects to CPUs were announced. On the SW side, the momentum around OpenCL is lowering the entry barriers. Tighter Integration of FPGAs and CPUs will allow traditional FPGA workloads to get closer to the more "general purpose" server and require less specialized custom boards.<br /><br />These emerging computing architectures generate innovative developments in computer science and applied mathematics, which in return, enable new capacities for scientific applications. The minisymposium will be an excellent opportunity to share some of the most recent, leading edge advances for scientific applications enabled by these trends. New algorithmic developments, and how to code them on the emerging architectures will be at the heart of the session: new PDE solvers for QCD, efficient implementation of Fast Multiple Methods applied to biomolecular simulations,&nbsp;how to use the cache-aware-roofline model to guide the performance optimization, and high energy physics workloads projecting efficient usage of nodes combining Xeon and FPGA.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa213"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:00 - 13:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Polarizable models, which can account dynamically for the changing electrostatic environment often found in proteins and DNA, are increasingly being recognized as the path forward to more accurate and predictive simulations. The cost has been a significant decrease in performance on the order of 10x, as one often has to iteratively solve for self-consistent dipole configurations. In this talk, I will present a sophisticated, polarizable force field model that has been combined with a highly parallel implementation of the Fast Multipole Method. Together, the cost overhead of using a polarizable force field has been significantly reduced, allowing simulations of large molecules to be achieved. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa206"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:30 - 14:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The challenges in the industry are many and varied, and include the need for a much better understanding of why certain promising drugs fail trials, how best to identify and model sub-groups in patient populations to deliver on the promises of precision medicine, and how to integrate information and models ranging from the molecular level up to patient-worn sensors.<br /><br />Due to their importance, the applied life sciences should be supported with the best possible tools to tackle these challenges. Whilst the use of computing is reasonably well established in this sector, the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) is much less well established when compared to other sectors such as engineering or physics. This is indeed unfortunate given the potential of in silico experiments and analysis of complex data to advance the state of the art in the field and deliver concrete benefits to society.<br /><br />In this minisymposium we will explore various approaches to the use of computing for the applied life sciences, ranging from lower-level systems modeling, through the application of large-scale machine learning to high volume screens in drug discovery, to analysis of genomic information. Each of these has different modeling and scaling challenges and has had varying levels of success in the application of HPC to the problem. We will have speakers from industry, academia and industrial-academic collaborations alike, giving varying perspectives on the state of the art and the potential for the application of HPC. <br /><br />The specific areas covered by the speakers will be the following:<br />- HPC implementation of multi-target compound activity prediction in chemogenomics based on state of the art large scale machine learning techniques<br />- Challenges in data handling and computation for the analysis of DNA for personalized healthcare<br />- Systems biology and HPC</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa170"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:00 - 13:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

However, the exuberant scale of the problem reaching 10^12 degrees of freedom, as well as the multi-scale complexity of the underlying parameter space render seismic applications as some of the most challenging HPC problems in the physical sciences. This is particularly the case for the inverse problem in mapping observations to parameters using millions of observations. Technical bottlenecks arise on many ends: meshing complex geological 3D structures, scalability, adaptivity to emerging architectures, data infrastructure for millions of simulations, provenance, code usability.<br /><br />In this minisymposium, we will hear about a diverse range of topics covering state-of-the-art wave propagation at scales between the globe and the human body, each with specifically adaptive techniques and their HPC solutions. Many of the talks will be based on different variants of the spectral-element technique, which has been dominating large-scale seismology for the past two decades. Novel variants include its scalable adaptation to tetrahedra, a new flexible implementation in C++, coupling to pseudo-spectral approaches, and scaling on emerging architectures. Other techniques will be the discontinuous Galerkin method for dynamic earthquake rupture, and an immersive approach to couple numerical modeling with wave tank experiments on FPGAs.<br /><br />Many of the talks will be driven by requirements from specific applications such as nonlinear earthquake rupture dynamics in a complex 3D geological fault system, multiscale geological structures at scales reaching the deep Earth interior, wave tank experiments, seismic tomography at large and industrial scales, and an application to breast cancer detection using ultrasound.<br /><br />In the discussion, we will strive to identify common bottlenecks, ideas to adapt to emerging architectures, any possible basic set of common algorithmic solutions, and discuss where one could move forward to consolidate different approaches based on any commonalities such as meshing, MPI-approaches, data infrastructures, or numerical solvers.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa250"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">15:30 - 16:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

It was used to study how cell biophysics affect the mechanical response of tissues to stretching, and inversely how tissue stretching may affect the mechanical properties of cells (Merzouki et al., Soft Matter, 2016).

Biol., 2007) to simulate cell monolayers. The model includes cells’ mechanical properties, proliferation and signalling. It was used to study how cell biophysics affect the mechanical response of tissues to stretching, and inversely how tissue stretching may affect the mechanical properties of cells (Merzouki et al., Soft Matter, 2016). We simulated tissue stretching and calibrated our model parameters using the experimental stress-strain results of Harris et al., PNAS, 2012. We found that the parameters must vary with the tissue strain to be in agreement with the experiments. Finally, we also use the model to study the morphogenesis of Acomys Dimidiatus spines (Montandon et al., EvoDevo, 2014).

CFD simulations, therefore, are a natural driver for exascale computing and have the potential for substantial societal impact, like reduced energy consumption, alternative sources of energy, improved health care, and improved climate models. Extreme scale CFD poses several cross-disciplinary challenges e.g. algorithmic issues in scalable solver design, handling of extreme sized data with compression and in-situ analysis, resilience and energy awareness in both hardware and algorithm design. The wide range of topics makes exascale CFD relevant to a wider HPC audience, extending outside the traditional fluid dynamics community. <br /><br />This minisymposium will be organized by the EU funded Horizon 2020 project ExaFLOW together with leading CFD experts from industry and will feature presentations showcasing their work on addressing key algorithmic challenges in CFD in order to facilitate simulations at exascale, e.g. accurate and scalable solvers, strategies to ensure fault tolerance and resilience. This session aims at bringing together the CFD community as a whole, from HPC experts to domain scientists, to discuss current and future challenges towards exascale fluid dynamics simulations and to facilitate international collaboration.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa217"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">15:30 - 16:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The application software at the heart of all prediction services throughout Europe is ill-equipped to efficiently adapt to the rapidly evolving heterogeneous hardware provided by the supercomputing industry. The solution is not to reduce the stringent requirements for Earth-system prediction but to combine scientific and computer-science expertise for defining and co-designing the necessary steps towards affordable, exascale high-performance simulations of weather and climate. The Energy-efficient and Scalable Algorithms for weather Prediction and Exascale (ESCAPE) projects brings together a consortium of weather prediction centres operating at global as well as European regional scales, university institutes performing research on numerical methods and novel code optimization techniques, HPC centres with vast experience in scalable code development and diverse processor technologies, large HPC hardware vendor companies operating market leading systems, as well as a European start-up SME with novel and emerging optical processor technologies to address the challenge of extreme-scale, energy-efficient high-performance computing. Key objectives of ESCAPE are to (i) define fundamental algorithm building blocks (&ldquo;weather & climate dwarfs&rdquo;) to foster trans-disciplinary research and innovation and to co-design, advance, benchmark and efficiently run the next generation of NWP and climate models on energy-efficient, heterogeneous HPC architectures, to (ii) diagnose and classify weather and climate dwarfs on different HPC architectures, and to (iii) combine frontier research on algorithm development and extreme-scale, high-performance computing applications with novel hardware technology, to create a flexible and sustainable weather and climate prediction system. This minisymposium will present the current state of prediction model component developments of weather and climate dwarfs within and beyond ESCAPE, and the implications on performance and employed programming models. This session acts in close collaboration with the minisymposium on &lsquo;Programming models and abstractions for weather and climate models: Today and in the futures&rsquo;.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa163"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">15:30 - 16:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Its goal is to reduce the gap between the worlds of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computer Aided Design (CAD). One of the key ideas in IgA is to use a common spline representation model for the design as well as for the analysis, providing a true design-through-analysis methodology.<br /><br />The IgA approach has been proved to be superior with respect to conventional FEA in various engineering application areas, including structural mechanics, electromagnetism, fluid-structure interaction. The keystones of this success are the many outstanding properties of the considered spline spaces and the associated B-spline basis. Spline representations allow for an efficient (geometric) manipulation, a high approximation power with respect to their degrees of freedom, appealing spectral properties, fast numerical linear algebra methods depending on spectral properties and/or tensor techniques.<br /><br />The minisymposium will address the most recent research directions and results related to <br />1) analysis of spectral properties in concrete applications<br />2) fast numerical linear algebra methods in connection with Bsplines, NURBS, extended spaces, etc.<em> </em></p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa101"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">15:30 - 16:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

In general, explicit time integrators are not suitable while the use of implicit methods leads to very ill-conditioned matrices. In this talk we will cover some reduced MHD problems (in 2d and 3d), show different time integrations schemes and study the corresponding linear systems. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa225"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">16:30 - 17:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The complexity of kinetic computations, in particular, their high dimensionality and multi-scale nature, lead to exciting challenges in physics, applied mathematics, and computer science. For example, modeling the plasma dynamics close to the edge of magnetic fusion devices requires codes which can flexibly handle complex geometries and implement enhanced gyrokinetic models or fully kinetic descriptions. Modern numerical tools such as multi-scale methods, structure-preserving schemes and isogeometric meshes, therefore, need to be adapted to plasma physics models in order to enhance state-of-the-art kinetic codes. At the same time, new programming models are necessary to prepare codes for the use on emerging heterogeneous HPC systems. This includes vectorization, cache efficient memory organization, task-based parallelism as well as new algorithms that are adapted to modern hardware. This minisymposium shall bring together scientists from physics, applied mathematics, and computer science to discuss current trends in the development of (gyro) kinetic codes.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa109"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">15:30 - 16:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Despite a long tradition of these methods in pharmaceutical applications their overall usefulness for chemistry and materials science has been limited. Only over the last couple of years, a number of machine learning (ML) studies have appeared with the commonality that quantum mechanical or atomistically resolved properties are being analyzed or predicted based on regression models defined in compositional and configurational space. The atomistic framework is crucial for the unbiased exploration of this space since it enables, at least in principle, the free variation of chemical composition, atomic weights, structure, and electron number. Substantial CPU investments have to be made in order to obtain sufficient training data using atomistic simulation protocol. This minisymposium boasts four of the most active players in the field who share a common background in developing computationally demanding atomistic simulation methods, and who have contributed new and original work based on unsupervised (Ceriotti and Varma) as well as supervised (Ghiringhelli and von Lilienfeld) learning.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa228"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">15:30 - 16:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

It will be challenging to continue to shrink feature sizes smaller than 5nm and still realize any performance improvement for digital electronics in silicon. At the current rate of development, the purported “End of Moore’s Law” will be reached in the middle to end of next decade.<br /><br />Shrinking the feature sizes of wires and transistors has been the driver for Moore’s Law for the past 5 decades, but what might lie beyond the end of current lithographic roadmaps and how will it affect computing as we know it? Moore’s Law is an economic theory after all, and any option that can make future computing more capable each new generation (by some measure) could continue Moore’s economic theory well into the future.<br /><br />The goal of this panel session is to communicate the options for extending computing beyond the end of our current silicon lithography roadmaps. The correct answers may be found in new ways to extend digital electronics efficiency or capability, or even new models of computation such as neuromorphic and quantum.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="panditem104"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">18:15 - 18:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

It can make predictions from noisy and unexpected input data. Any artificial system implementing all or some of those features is likely to have a large impact on the way we process information. With the increasingly detailed data from neuroscience and the availability of advanced VLSI process nodes the dream of building physical models of neural circuits on a meaningful scale of complexity is coming closer to realization. Such models deviate strongly from classical processor-memory based numerical machines as the two functions merge into a massively parallel network of almost identical cells. Neuromorphic architectures are considered an attractive approach to implement cognitive computing in hardware. Recent implementations of deep learning with convolutional neural networks on traditional architectures have shown remarkable results which have led to a debate on whether more biological detail like spike communication would be useful or just a burden. \n\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\nThis panel will discuss this open question and argue for a systematic approach towards neuromorphic architectures with an optimized degree of biological realism.

His group pioneered several innovations in the field like the conception of a description language for neural circuits (PyNN), time-compressed mixed-signal neuromorphic computing systems and wafer-scale integration for their implementation.\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nHe led 2 major European initiatives, FACETS and BrainScaleS, that both demonstrated the rewarding interdisciplinary collaboration of neuroscience and information science. In 2009 he was one of the initiators of the European Human Brain Project (HBP) that was approved in 2013. In the HBP he leads the subproject on neuromorphic computing with the goal of establishing brain-inspired computing paradigms as tools for neuroscience and generic methods for inference from large data volumes.","first_name":"Karlheinz","last_name":"Meier","affiliation":"University of Heidelberg","country":"Germany","is_presenter":"1"}

It can make predictions from noisy and unexpected input data. Any artificial system implementing all or some of those features is likely to have a large impact on the way we process information. With the increasingly detailed data from neuroscience and the availability of advanced VLSI process nodes the dream of building physical models of neural circuits on a meaningful scale of complexity is coming closer to realization. Such models deviate strongly from classical processor-memory based numerical machines as the two functions merge into a massively parallel network of almost identical cells. Neuromorphic architectures are considered an attractive approach to implement cognitive computing in hardware. Recent implementations of deep learning with convolutional neural networks on traditional architectures have shown remarkable results which have led to a debate on whether more biological detail like spike communication would be useful or just a burden. <br/><br/>This panel will discuss this open question and argue for a systematic approach towards neuromorphic architectures with an optimized degree of biological realism. This panel will introduce current projects worldwide and the approach proposed by the EU Human Brain Project to establish a systematic path from biological data to brain derived neuromorphic machines with a very high degree of configurability. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="session-head simple"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> <span>19:30 - 22:00</span> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>Social evening event (separate registration required)</strong>, Ristorante Ciani</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="tuesday"> <div class="section"> <div class="sessions-collection"> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess212-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess212" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> <span>09:00 - 09:50</span> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>Invited Plenary - Unlocking the Mysteries of the Universe with Supercomputers</strong>, Room A</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right"> <g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess212"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="session-introduction"> <div class="table session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Chair:</div> <div class="td"> <div class="chairs inline"> <div class="author"> Thomas Quinn (University of Washington, United States of America)</span> <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

Our algorithm is able\nto obtain an analytical form for the DOS expressed in a chosen basis\nset, instead of a numerical array of finite resolution as in previous\nvariants of this class of MC methods such as the multicanonical\n(MUCA) sampling and Wang-Landau (WL) sampling.

As the compute capabilities have continuously increased over the past decades, computational models or applications requiring information about inner eigenstates of sparse matrices have become numerically accessible in many research fields. At the same time new algorithms (e.g. FEAST or SSM) have been introduced and long-standing methods such as filter diagonalization are still being applied, improved and extended. However, the trend towards highly parallel (heterogeneous) compute systems is challenging the efficiency of existing solver packages as well as building block libraries, and calls for new massively parallel solvers with high hardware efficiency across different architectures. Thus, substantial effort is put into the implementation of new sparse (eigen)solver frameworks which face challenges in terms of ease of use, extendibility, sustainability and hardware efficiency. Software engineering and holistic performance engineering concepts are deployed to address these challenges. The significant momentum in the application fields, numerical methods and software layers calls for a strong interaction between scientists involved in those activities to provide sustainable and hardware efficient frameworks to compute inner eigenvalues of large sparse matrices. The minisymposium offers a platform to bring together leading experts in this field to discuss recent developments at all levels: from the application down to hardware efficient implementations of basic kernel operations. Application experts will present their current and upcoming research requiring the computation of inner eigenvalues. State-of-the-art eigensolvers and new algorithmic developments will be discussed along with challenges faced by library developers in terms of software sustainability and hardware efficiency. Many of these topics are not limited to the inner sparse eigenvalue problems but are of general interest for sparse linear algebra algorithms for current and future HPC architectures.<br /><br />Part 1 of the minisymposium focuses on applications and algorithms.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa153"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">11:00 - 11:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The complexity of kinetic computations, in particular, their high dimensionality and multi-scale nature, lead to exciting challenges in physics, applied mathematics, and computer science. For example, modeling the plasma dynamics close to the edge of magnetic fusion devices requires codes which can flexibly handle complex geometries and implement enhanced gyrokinetic models or fully kinetic descriptions. Modern numerical tools such as multi-scale methods, structure-preserving schemes and isogeometric meshes, therefore, need to be adapted to plasma physics models in order to enhance state-of-the-art kinetic codes. At the same time, new programming models are necessary to prepare codes for the use on emerging heterogeneous HPC systems. This includes vectorization, cache efficient memory organization, task-based parallelism as well as new algorithms that are adapted to modern hardware.

We present a new two-fold (theoretical and numerical) generic framework for GK code verification; the multi-species electromagnetic ORB5 (PIC) and the global version of GENE (Eulerian) are considered as examples. The first part of this work contains a common theoretical framework for the systematic derivation of the ORB5 and GENE code models, while the second part is dedicated to the inter-code benchmark.

We present a new two-fold (theoretical and numerical) generic framework for GK code verification; the multi-species electromagnetic ORB5 (PIC) and the global version of GENE (Eulerian) are considered as examples. The first part of this work contains a common theoretical framework for the systematic derivation of the ORB5 and GENE code models, while the second part is dedicated to the inter-code benchmark. A detailed analysis of micro-instabilities identified the main numerical difficulties such as requirement of a large radial resolution. Detailed verifications of global electromagnetic test cases developed from the CYCLONE Base Case are considered, including a parametric &#946;-scan covering the transition from ITG to KBM and the spectral properties at the nominal &#946; value.

We will mainly consider two examples: first, molten carbonates that are used as electrolyte for molten salt fuel cells and have been proposed for elctrochemical conversion of CO2, and second, osmotic energy conversion by chemisorption of hydroxide on boron nitride membranes. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess188-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess188" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>MS20 Particle-Based Methods for Simulations in Life Sciences, Fluids and Materials (1/2)</strong>, Villa Ciani, Room 005</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right"> <g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess188"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="table organizer-items session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Organizer(s):</div> <div class="td"> <div class="organizers inline"> <div class="author"> Igor Pivkin (Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)</span> <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

Emerging heterogeneous high-performance architectures are a unique opportunity to address these requirements in an energy- and time-efficient manner. The hardware changes of emerging computing platforms are accompanied by dramatic changes in programming paradigms. These changes have only just started. Adapting current weather and climate codes to efficiently exploit such architectures requires an effort which is both costly and error-prone. The long software lifecycles of weather and climate codes renders the situation even more critical, as hardware life cycles are much shorter in comparison. Furthermore, atmospheric models are developed and used by a large variety of researchers on a myriad of computing platforms, which makes portability a crucial requirement in any kind of development. Developers of weather and climate models are struggling to achieve a better separation of concerns in order to separate the high-level specification of equations and solution algorithms from the hardware dependent, optimized low-level implementation. It is probable that the solutions to achieve this will be different for different parts of the codes, due to different predominant algorithmic motifs and data-structures. On the example of concrete porting efforts, this session will illustrate different approaches used today and (possibly) in the future.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa162"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">11:00 - 11:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

And yet, the scientific missions requires these applications to run at very high performance on a broad range of hardware. Applications therefore need to be written abstractly enough to guarantee portability while expressively enough to enable high performance. OpenACC and OpenMP are well established standards for expressing parallelism and data locality, whereas data management layers like Atlas or GridTools offer target independent data structures.

And yet, the scientific missions requires these applications to run at very high performance on a broad range of hardware. Applications therefore need to be written abstractly enough to guarantee portability while expressively enough to enable high performance. OpenACC and OpenMP are well established standards for expressing parallelism and data locality, whereas data management layers like Atlas or GridTools offer target independent data structures. Within the ESCAPE project we therefore investigate whether these tools meet the performance and portability requirements of the weather and climate community. Isolating core algorithmic motifs of operational models into so-called dwarfs, we can quickly explore and compare different implementations. In this talk we will discuss results of optimization efforts on CPUs, CPU+Xeon Phi and GPUs, using different performance portable approaches. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa269"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">12:00 - 12:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Quantum mechanics based approaches must necessarily serve as a foundational role, since only these approaches can describe matter in a truly first-principles (parameter-free) and therefore robust manner. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are ideal candidates for this since they robustly deliver highly accurate calculations of complex materials, and with increased computer power provide systematically improvable accuracies that are not possible with other first principles methods. By directly solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation and by treating the electrons at a consistent many-body level, these methods can be applied to general elements and materials, and are unique in satisfying robust variational principles. More accurate solutions result in lower variational energies, enabling robust confidence intervals to be assigned to predictions. The stochastic nature of QMC facilitates mapping onto high-performance computing architectures. QMC is one of the few computational materials methods capable of fully exploiting today&rsquo;s petaflop machines. <br /><br />This symposium will present some of the latest developments on QMC methods, from an application and a development perspective.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa238"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">11:00 - 11:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

It is general and applicable to a wide range of physical and chemical systems in any dimension, boundary conditions etc. The favorable scaling of O(N3) for an N-electron system and ample opportunities for parallelization make QMC methods uniquely powerful tools to study the electronic structure of realistic systems on large-scale parallel computers. This scalability has enabled calculations on a wide variety of systems, including large molecules, layered materials, transition metal oxides and general bulk properties of solids. In this talk, I will present the recent algorithmic developments implemented in the QMCPACK simulation code allowing it to run at scale on Leadership Class Supercomputer and a sample of applications enabled through these developments. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess168-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess168" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>MS23 Virtual Patients, Virtual Doctors, Virtual Hospitals</strong>, Room C1</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right"> <g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess168"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="table organizer-items session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Organizer(s):</div> <div class="td"> <div class="organizers inline"> <div class="author"> Rainald Ehrig (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany)</span>, <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

Diseases such as endometriosis or the polycystic ovary syndrome seriously disturb menstrual cycle patterns, oocyte maturation and consequently fertility. Besides endocrine diseases, several environmental and lifestyle factors, especially smoking and obesity, also have a negative impact on fertility. Modern techniques in reproductive medicine like in-vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection have increased the chances for successful reproduction. However, current success rates vary significantly among clinics, still reaching only about 35% even in well-functioning centers. This is mainly due to the usage of different treatment protocols and limited knowledge about individual variability in the dynamics of reproductive processes. <br /><br />This minisymposium brings together researchers with different scientific backgrounds (computer science, mathematics, medicine) who work on developing model-based clinical decision support systems for reproductive endocrinologists enabling the simulation and optimization of treatment strategies in-silico. Virtual physiological human (VPH) models together with patient specific parameterizations (Virtual Patients), formalized treatment strategies (Virtual Doctors) and software tools (Virtual Hospital) enable in silico clinical trials, that is clinical trials performed by means of computer simulations over a population of virtual patients. In silico clinical trials are recognized as a disruptive key innovation for medicine, as they allow medical scientists to reduce and postpone invasive, risky, costly and time-consuming in vivo experiments of new treatments to much later stages of the testing process, when a deeper knowledge of their effectiveness and side-effects has been acquired via simulations. <br /><br />The talks in the minisymposium will highlight different aspects of a virtual hospital in reproductive medicine.<br /><br />- Distributed service oriented systems for clinical decision support<br />- HPC within in silico clinical trials<br />- Construction of large virtual patient populations <br />- Formalization of treatment strategies in silico <br />- VPH model validation, treatment verification and the design of individualized protocols <br />- Databases and software for the virtual hospital<br />- Large scale integrated physiology models</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa229"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">11:00 - 11:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The space-charge layer plays an important role in semiconductor physics, leading to several fundamentals of electronic devices. On the other hand, the electrochemistry always takes into account the electric double layer, crucial for catalysis, solar cell and battery applications. These modulations of charge-carrier distributions can expand up to micrometer scale, though nanometer-scale modulation happens as well in several cases. Therefore, sole first-principles electronic structure calculation does not work well. For these issues, special techniques to deal with the interface are necessary, on top of the large-scale and long-time QM-based simulations. QM/MM techniques or combinations of QM and continuum or classical theories can be potential solutions. This minisymposium brings together cutting-edge researchers working on these issues to discuss and evaluate individual methods and suggest future directions. This is important since relationships among the methods for the interfaces are difficult to see. Besides, the material-science flavor of this minisymposium provides perspectives addressing computer scientists and applied mathematicians, which will encourage future developments of interdisciplinary techniques.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa249"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">14:00 - 14:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

For example, in a secondary battery, the electrode-electrolyte interface determines the durability of the battery, and in a fuel cell, the catalytic activity at the interface determines its performance. We are conducting research aiming at improving the performance of those electrochemical devices and presenting design guidelines by clarifying the microscopic process of chemical reaction at the electrochemical interface using first principles simulation. In this talk, I will introduce the simulation technique developed by us and present recent simulation results for the cyclic voltammogram of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction. I will also present more recent progress of simulation techniques for the solid-liquid interface. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa245"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">15:30 - 16:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

In their cores, particles are squeezed together more tightly than in atomic nuclei and no terrestrial experiment can reproduce the extreme physical conditions of density, temperature, and gravity. With such properties, it is clear that neutron stars in binary systems are unique laboratories to explore fundamental physics &ndash; such as the state of matter at nuclear densities &ndash; and fundamental astrophysics &ndash; such as the one behind the &ldquo;central engine&rdquo; in short gamma-ray bursts. Yet, such an exploration does not come easy. The nonlinear dynamics of binary neutron stars, which requires the combined solution of the Einstein equations together with those of relativistic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, and the complex microphysics that accompanies the inspiral and merger, make sophisticated numerical simulations in three dimensions the only route for an accurate modeling. <br /><br />This minisymposium will focus on the gravitational-wave emission during the inspiral and the connection between merging binaries and the corresponding electromagnetic counterpart. These two problems require urgent attention as they are both likely to play an important role in the imminent detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars by interferometric detectors such as LIGO and Virgo.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa136"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">14:00 - 14:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

As the compute capabilities have continuously increased over the past decades, computational models or applications requiring information about inner eigenstates of sparse matrices have become numerically accessible in many research fields. At the same time new algorithms (e.g. FEAST or SSM) have been introduced and long-standing methods such as filter diagonalization are still being applied, improved and extended. However, the trend towards highly parallel (heterogeneous) compute systems is challenging the efficiency of existing solver packages as well as building block libraries and calls for new massively parallel solvers with high hardware efficiency across different architectures. Thus, substantial effort is put into the implementation of new sparse (eigen)solver frameworks which face challenges both in terms easy to use, extendibility, sustainability, and hardware efficiency. Software engineering and holistic performance engineering concepts are deployed to address these challenges. The significant momentum in the application fields, numerical methods, and software layers calls for a strong interaction between scientists involved in those activities to provide sustainable and hardware efficient frameworks to compute inner eigenvalues of large sparse matrices. The minisymposium offers a platform to bring together leading experts in this field to discuss recent developments at all levels: from the application down to hardware efficient implementations of basic kernel operations. Application experts will present their current and upcoming research fields requiring the computation of inner eigenvalues. State-of-the-art eigensolvers and new algorithmic developments will be discussed along with challenges faced by library developers in terms of software sustainability and hardware efficiency. Many of these topics are not limited to the inner sparse eigenvalue problems but are of general interest for sparse linear algebra algorithms for current and future HPC architectures.<br /><br />Part 2 of the minisymposium focuses on algorithms as well as software and performance aspects.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa148"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">14:00 - 14:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The complexity of kinetic computations, in particular, their high dimensionality and multi-scale nature, lead to exciting challenges in physics, applied mathematics, and computer science. For example, modeling the plasma dynamics close to the edge of magnetic fusion devices requires codes which can flexibly handle complex geometries and implement enhanced gyrokinetic models or fully kinetic descriptions. Modern numerical tools such as multi-scale methods, structure-preserving schemes, and isogeometric meshes, therefore, need to be adapted to plasma physics models in order to enhance state-of-the-art kinetic codes. At the same time, new programming models are necessary to prepare codes for the use on emerging heterogeneous HPC systems. This includes vectorization, cache efficient memory organization, task-based parallelism as well as new algorithms that are adapted to modern hardware. This minisymposium shall bring together scientists from physics, applied mathematics, and computer science to discuss current trends in the development of (gyro) kinetic codes.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa188"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">14:00 - 14:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The knowledge obtained can be used for the design of new gyrokinetic codes and the design of new supercomputers. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess162-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess162" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>MS29 Mathematical Methods in Molecular Simulation for Computational Drug Design</strong>, Room C1</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right"> <g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess162"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="table organizer-items session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Organizer(s):</div> <div class="td"> <div class="organizers inline"> <div class="author"> Franziska Erlekam (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany)</span> <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

On the hardware side, challenges will arise due to the expected increase in the number of components, variable operational modes (e.g. lower voltage to address energy requirements), and increasing complexity (e.g. memory hierarchies, heterogeneous cores, more, smaller transistors). The software stack will need to keep up with the increasing hardware complexity, hence becoming itself more error-prone.<br /> <br />In general, we can distinguish between three main categories of faults, namely hard (where a hardware component fails and needs to be fixed/replaced), soft/transient (a fault occurs, but is corrected by the hardware or low-level system software), and silent/undetectable (an error occurs but cannot be detected and fixed). The first two categories have a well-defined impact on the run and the system itself. The third class is more subtle because its effect is simply to alter stored, transmitted, or processed information, and there is no opportunity for an application to directly recover from a fault. This can lead to noticeable impacts such as crashes and hangs, as well as corrupted results. <br /><br />Current systems do not have an integrated approach to fault tolerance, namely the various subsystems have their own mechanisms for error detection and recovery (e.g. ECC memory). Also, there is no good error isolation, e.g. the failure of any component in a parallel job generally causes the entire job to fail. In fact, the current standard of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) system does not support failing ranks. Common approaches for fault-tolerance include hardware-level redundancy, algorithmic error correction code and checkpoint/restart. The latter is currently the most widely used approach. However, the tight power budget targeted for future systems and the expected shortening of the mean-time-between-failures (MTBF) may cause it to become an unfeasible solution for extreme-scale computing.<br /> <br />It is increasingly more recognized that hardware-only resilience will likely become unfeasible in the long term. This sets the need to develop an integrated approach, where resilience is tackled across all layers to mitigate the impact of faults in a holistic fashion, keeping under consideration its interplay with the energy budget. Hence, in parallel to the continuous effort aimed at improving resilience for hardware and system software, new approaches/ideas need to be incorporated at the highest level, i.e. algorithms and applications, to account for potential faults, e.g. silent data corruptions (SDCs). In other words, algorithms themselves need to be made more robust and resilient. <br /><br />This minisymposium explores HPC resilience in the context of algorithms, applications, hardware, system and runtimes. Specifically, the talks have been selected to cover topics ranging, e.g., from solvers, programming models and energy-aware computing, to approximate computing, memory vulnerability and post-Moore&rsquo;s.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa116"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">14:00 - 14:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Inexact computing may be one way to address these problems. Inexact computing includes both probabilistic and approximate computing techniques. Probabilistic computation dates back to the 50s. The calculation is done non-deterministically and the result may be correct or “correct enough”. Approximate computation is deterministic, and produces results that are “close enough”, where the lack of precision may be due to word length limits or numerical methods. There is some overlap between the fields of resilience/reliability and inexact computing. In this talk, we discuss the commonalities between the fields. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="session-head simple"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> <span>16:00 - 16:30</span> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>Coffee Break</strong>, Foyer</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess228-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess228" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> <span>16:30 - 17:30</span> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>Panel Discussion - Sustainable Software Development and Publication Practices in the Computational Sciences</strong>, Room A</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right"> <g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g> </svg> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess228"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="title"><h4>PNL02 Sustainable Software Development and Publication Practices in the Computational Sciences</h4></div> <div class="session-introduction"> <div class="table session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Chair:</div> <div class="td"> <div class="chairs inline"> <div class="author"> Jack Wells (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, United States of America)</span> <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

	</script></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="abstract"> <div class="text"> <p>The goal of the PASC papers program is to advance the quality of formal scientific communication between the relative disciplines of computational science and engineering. The program was built from an observation that the computer science community traditionally publishes in the proceedings of major, international conferences, while the domain science community generally publishes in discipline-specific journals – and cross readership is very limited. The aim of our initiative is to build and sustain a platform that enables engagement between the computer science, applied mathematics and domain science communities, through a combination of conference participation, conference papers and post-conference journal publications. The PASC papers initiative allows authors to benefit from the interdisciplinarity and rapid dissemination of results afforded by the conference venue, as well as from the impact associated with subsequent publication in a high-quality scientific journal. To help facilitate such journal publication, PASC has recently formed collaborative partnerships with a number of scientific journals, including Computer Physics Communications (CPC), the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES), and ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (ACM TOMS). In this panel discussion, representatives from these journals are invited to express their thoughts regarding publication practices in the computational sciences, including the publication of software codes. We will discuss best practices for sustainable software development and address questions such as: how can we ensure that code and infrastructure will still be there in ten-plus years? How can we validate published results and guarantee reproducibility? Finally, we will describe our vision for the PASC papers initiative going forward.<br /><br />Panelists:<br /><br />- Thomas Schulthess (CSCS / ETH Zurich, Switzerland)<br />- Walter Dehnen (University of Leicester): Editor (Astronomy and Astrophysics) for Computer Physics Communications (CPC)<br />- Robert Pincus (University of Colorado): Editor in Chief of the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)<br />- Michael A.

We introduce a framework for sparse tensor linear algebra, which enables low-scaling electronic structure methods beyond density  functional theory. This framework is based on DBCSR for mapping tensor contractions block-wise to matrix-matrix multiplications. We also report on optimizations and performance comparison of the MPI communications, based on 2.5D algorithm, and the backends, namely\nLIBXSMM and CUDA.

For this task, the sparse matrix library DBCSR [1] has been developed. Its multi-layered structure automatically takes care of and optimizes several computational aspects like parallelism (MPI, OMP, GPU), data (cache) locality and on-the-fly filtering. We introduce a framework for sparse tensor linear algebra, which enables low-scaling electronic structure methods beyond density functional theory. This framework is based on DBCSR for mapping tensor contractions block-wise to matrix-matrix multiplications. We also report on optimizations and performance comparison of the MPI communications, based on 2.5D algorithm, and the backends, namelyLIBXSMM and CUDA. Furthermore, in order to facilitate usability, a suite of tools has been developed to auto-generate the full documentation of the library.

Containers are a type of lightweight virtualization technology that attempts to solve this problem by packaging applications and their runtime environments into standard units of software that are: portable, easy to build and deploy, have a small footprint and a low runtime overhead. In this poster, we present a container workflow for HPC applications using two tools: Docker, for building and packaging applications into containers; and Shifter, a container runtime that has been built to fulfill the specific needs of HPC. We will present use cases of building and testing containers on workstations and deploying them on HPC systems, where they take advantage of the available specialized-hardware: fast interconnects and GPU accelerators. We will provide performance results for a variety of scientific applications and discuss how such workflow can aid HPC users.","begin_time":"19:00","begin_timestamp":"1522256400","end_time":"21:00","end_timestamp":"1522263600","session_date":"Tuesday, June 27, 2017","room":"Foyer"},"authors":{"primary":[{"id":"post130","title":"Mr.","bio":"","first_name":"Kean","last_name":"Mariotti","affiliation":"ETH Zurich \/ CSCS","country":"Switzerland","is_presenter":"1"}],"secondary":[{"id":"post130","title":"Mr.","bio":"","first_name":"Kean","last_name":"Mariotti","affiliation":"ETH Zurich \/ CSCS","country":"Switzerland","is_presenter":"1"},{"id":"post130","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"Benedicic","affiliation":"ETH Zurich \/ CSCS","country":"Switzerland","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"post130","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Felipe A.","last_name":"Cruz","affiliation":"ETH Zurich \/ CSCS","country":"Switzerland","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"post130","title":"Mr.","bio":"","first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"Madonna","affiliation":"ETH Zurich \/ CSCS","country":"Switzerland","is_presenter":"0"}]},"presentation_file":"post130s2.pdf"},"sessionDate":"Tuesday, June 27, 2017","room":"Foyer","settings":null}

Containers are a type of lightweight virtualization technology that attempts to solve this problem by packaging applications and their runtime environments into standard units of software that are: portable, easy to build and deploy, have a small footprint and a low runtime overhead. In this poster, we present a container workflow for HPC applications using two tools: Docker, for building and packaging applications into containers; and Shifter, a container runtime that has been built to fulfill the specific needs of HPC. We will present use cases of building and testing containers on workstations and deploying them on HPC systems, where they take advantage of the available specialized-hardware: fast interconnects and GPU accelerators. We will provide performance results for a variety of scientific applications and discuss how such workflow can aid HPC users. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="post143"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">19:00 - 21:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

SPHEROS is able to handle the interaction between fluid, solid, and sediment. In order to accelerate SPHEROS, GPU-SPHEROS has been developed in CUDA featuring Thrust library and highly optimized kernels for both compute-bound and memory-bound algorithms. Up to now, remarkable speedup has been achieved for some parts including particle neighbor search and computing fluxes and forces and we are now focusing our efforts on the identified bottlenecks. The bottlenecks are mostly located in the computation of particles interaction vectors, which is based on spherical-support kernels. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="post120"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">19:00 - 21:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Although the idea has been a part of healthcare for many years (e.g. blood transfusions), research in precision medicine has spurred a lot of interest recently due to the accessibility to large volumes of complex genomics and other biomedical datasets as well as digitized medical records and the development of novel methods and tools in data science. Sound, interoperable high-performance computing and &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; analytics and management infrastructures are key to the success of research programs such as the &ldquo;Swiss Personalized Health Network&rdquo; (SPHN) initiative starting in 2017. These infrastructures will have to be built in collaboration and coordination between hospitals and universities to allow researchers to perform biomedical research on real patient data beyond institutional and geographical boundaries. A particular challenge of this novel infrastructure is the combination of high-performance and Big Data storage and computing resources and data management services with high data security and compliance requirements, so it can fulfill the regulations of the respective federal laws (in Switzerland, particularly the Human Research Act (Humanforschungsgesetz, HFG)) and international best practices in the field.<br /><br />This minisymposium aims at bringing together experts from biomedical research, hospital and university computing and data service providers, as well as from the side of Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI), and will put the subject into the larger perspective of the upcoming Swiss national research initiative on personalized health care.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa266"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">09:00 - 09:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Large amounts of measured and simulated information from all kinds of processes have been accumulated in a wide range of areas - from weather and climate research to astrophysics and neuroscience. If knowledge about such systems is present only in the form of observations or measurement data, the challenging problem of understanding the system becomes a problem of pattern recognition and model reduction in multiple dimensions. Optimization methods have manifested themselves as a central pillar for practical implementations of these data analysis problems, allowing a unified handling of a wide variety of data analysis algorithms. These include clustering methods (standard K-means, fuzzy-C-means, or Fuzzy Clustering based on Regression Models (FCRM)) as well as of the more advanced methods based on concepts from Artificial Neuronal Networks (ANNs) and nonparametric/nonstationary data analysis.<br /><br />A central challenge in solving such data analysis problems lies in not imposing too many &ndash; potentially inappropriate &ndash; a priori assumptions on the available data. Also in this respect recent advances in high-performance optimisation methods can assist development of data analysis methods, through appropriate regularisation concepts and related tools. Recent progress in GPU-based high-performance computing implementations of optimisation methods enables us now to apply these techniques to ever larger problems, for instance from causality inference, image denoising, data compression, market phases identification in finance - among many others.<br /><br />In this minisymposium we will discuss the current state of the art in the optimisation-driven multidimensional data analysis problems, understand their parallel programming issues &ndash; particularly in a view of the emergence of disruptive processor technology, such as clusters of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and other accelerators (e.g., Intel Xeon Phi) &ndash; and hear about their application to various data analysis problems from different areas. Also recent work on the development of community libraries for HPC optimisation software will be presented.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa117"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">09:00 - 09:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its associated experiments have allowed us to observe the particles and processes that lie at the foundation of our current understanding of the physical world. Furthermore, the LHC and other high-energy physics (HEP) facilities continue to produce data at an ever increasing rate, allowing us to peer beyond the Standard Model.<br /><br />In order to filter, process, and analyze the data captured at particle detectors, the HEP community has had over the last decades an insatiable appetite for computing power. Today the LHC experiments record around 150 PB/year. The rate of interactions to be studied will increase by a factor of 100 in the next 10 to 15 years.<br /><br />Computing at the LHC experiments happens mostly in two domains. In Online Computing, data captured at the detector must be processed and filtered using near-realtime, high-throughput computing software frameworks. The reconstruction of a particle collision event employs a large number of complex algorithms before the results are stored for further analysis. Offline computing deals with the physics analysis of the large data sets captured by the detector and retained by the online computing software. <br /><br />In this session we take a closer look at detector simulation and data analysis in HEP experiments. Much work has been devoted in recent years to further develop&nbsp;the existing software frameworks to better take advantage of modern hardware architectures. This includes shared-memory parallelism, vectorization and support for coprocessors and accelerators. Furthermore, the recent advancements in the field of machine learning are finding a number of applications in high-energy physics. The presentations discuss these simulation and data-analysis frameworks in the context of high-performance computing and modern hardware architectures.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa292"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">09:00 - 09:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The High Throughput Computing Collaboration (HTCC) is investigating the use of next-generation Intel hardware technologies in this context. In this presentation we will show results from our network infrastructure feasibility studies on 100 G interconnects.

The data will then be filtered in a software-based trigger for interesting particle collisions. The design of such a system poses performance challenges in the interconnect, compute hardware platforms and software infrastructure. The High Throughput Computing Collaboration (HTCC) is investigating the use of next-generation Intel hardware technologies in this context. In this presentation we will show results from our network infrastructure feasibility studies on 100 G interconnects. In addition, we present new developments on vectorized and thread-parallelized algorithms used in the Online reconstruction software. In order to fully take advantage of modern hardware platforms, alternatives to the existing implementations that exploit SIMD capabilities and multi/manycore architectures are being explored. Performance is measured and compared across a variety of architectures taking into account the cost and energy requirements. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa125"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">10:30 - 11:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Computer simulations have been used since the early 70s to study the physical and chemical properties of biomolecules and they have played in the recent years an even more relevant role in elucidating, complementing and also predicting the experimental observables. The chemical reactivity of biomolecules can be studied in-silico at different levels of accuracy and dimension using electron-based, atom-based, and multiscale models. The choice among the different approaches depends on the property of the system the scientists aim to investigate. Electron transfer reactions, ligand/protein binding, and protein-protein interactions are only a few examples of the biological processes that can be investigated through computer simulations.<br /><br />The main limitations of the computational approaches are represented by:<br />- Timescale of the biological processes;<br />- Size of the system to simulate;<br />- Accuracy in the system&rsquo;s description;<br /><br />The continuous effort of the scientific community to overcome such limitations has led to important advances represented by the development of novel methods and the improved performance of the simulation codes on the modern-day computer architectures such as high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. The scientific literature shows many successful examples where simulations unravel complex biochemical problems and some of those are illustrated in the present minisymposium.<br /><br />The minisymposium also represents an opportunity, particularly for young researchers, to discuss with some of the word-leading scientists in the field the state-of-the-art simulation techniques and draw a line towards the future of biomolecular simulations.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa259"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">09:00 - 09:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

We underline that besides offering computational efficiency this new approach provides a qualitative new point of view that will have far reaching consequences in the future. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>	</div> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess182-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess182" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>MS37 Linear Algebra and High Performance Computing for Computational Nanoelectronics</strong>, Room C1</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right">	<g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g>	</g></svg></div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g></svg></div> </div> </div> </div>	</div> </a>	</div>	<div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess182"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="table organizer-items session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Organizer(s):</div> <div class="td"> <div class="organizers inline"> <div class="author"> Matthias Bollhöfer (TU Braunschweig, Germany)</span> <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

Biological examples of active matter range in scale by many orders of magnitude from swarms of motile bacteria to schools of fish. They can together exhibit such phenomena as collective motion and dynamic self-organization. Understanding the basic principles governing inherently non-equilibrium active matter is a difficult challenge. One of the approaches to achieve this goal is to create synthetic systems that can reproduce behaviors typical for living matter, which can be studied to understand complex phenomena emerging in active matter. Computational modeling plays a critical role in this process enabling both better understanding of biological systems and devising synthetic systems that can be then experimentally tested.

However, recent studies have suggested the involvement of non-equilibrium processes, without definitively ruling out equilibrium interpretations. Using active and passive microrheology to directly compare the membrane response and fluctuations on single cells, we find a violation of the fluctuation\u2013dissipation relation, which is a direct demonstration of the non-equilibrium nature of flickering. With realistic stochastic simulations and an analytical model of the composite erythrocyte membrane, we show that several molecular mechanisms (e.g., spectrin network remodeling and ion pumps) may explain the active fluctuations, and we predict their kinetics. We are also able to quantitatively extract RBC membrane properties including shear elasticity, bending rigidity, and membrane viscosity. Our findings provide solid experimental and theoretical frameworks for future investigations of the origin and function of active motion in cells.","begin_time":"09:30","begin_timestamp":"1522222200","end_time":"10:00","end_timestamp":"1522224000","session_date":"Wednesday, June 28, 2017","room":"Room C2-3"},"authors":{"primary":[{"id":"msa174","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Dmitry","last_name":"Fedosov","affiliation":"Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich","country":"Germany","is_presenter":"1"}],"secondary":[{"id":"msa174","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Dmitry","last_name":"Fedosov","affiliation":"Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich","country":"Germany","is_presenter":"1"},{"id":"msa174","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Basile","last_name":"Audoly","affiliation":"Institut Jean Le Rond d\u2019Alembert","country":"France","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"msa174","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Thorsten","last_name":"Auth","affiliation":"Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich","country":"Germany","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"msa174","title":"Prof.","bio":"","first_name":"Timo","last_name":"Betz","affiliation":"ZMBE","country":"Germany","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"msa174","title":"Prof.","bio":"","first_name":"Gerhard","last_name":"Gompper","affiliation":"Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich","country":"Germany","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"msa174","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Nir","last_name":"Gov","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science","country":"Israel","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"msa174","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Jean-Francois","last_name":"Joanny","affiliation":"Institut Curie","country":"France","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"msa174","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Cecile","last_name":"Sykes","affiliation":"Institut Curie","country":"France","is_presenter":"0"},{"id":"msa174","title":"Dr.","bio":"","first_name":"Herve","last_name":"Turlier","affiliation":"European Molecular Biology Laboratory","country":"Germany","is_presenter":"0"}]}},"sessionDate":"Wednesday, June 28, 2017","room":"Room C2-3","settings":null}

However, recent studies have suggested the involvement of non-equilibrium processes, without definitively ruling out equilibrium interpretations. Using active and passive microrheology to directly compare the membrane response and fluctuations on single cells, we find a violation of the fluctuation–dissipation relation, which is a direct demonstration of the non-equilibrium nature of flickering. With realistic stochastic simulations and an analytical model of the composite erythrocyte membrane, we show that several molecular mechanisms (e.g., spectrin network remodeling and ion pumps) may explain the active fluctuations, and we predict their kinetics. We are also able to quantitatively extract RBC membrane properties including shear elasticity, bending rigidity, and membrane viscosity. Our findings provide solid experimental and theoretical frameworks for future investigations of the origin and function of active motion in cells. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa177"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">10:00 - 10:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Astrophysical disks in particular exhibit large Mach numbers, turbulence, ionization, shock waves and are subject to many nonlinear instabilities. Compared to geophysical and laboratory flows, a lot of improvements have been made during the last decades to the numerical methods used in this field. Finite volume methods, mesh refinement, moving mesh and other recent developments such as Lagrangian methods that improve on conventional particle-based methods (SPH) are used with efficiency; today's large supercomputers also allow one to run long term 3D calculations that were unfeasible ten years ago. The results of these simulations give a new picture of the dynamics of these disks, and contribute significantly to the astrophysics. Planet formation models are improved, disk observations can be predicted and understood, new instabilities are discovered, and much more will be done in the coming years.<br /> <br /> We present in this minisymposium some recent developments in the field, presented by code developers and expert users. We will focus in particular on: (i) different state-of-the-art solvers for the fluid equations of a single fluid component and (ii) methods that handle the solution for coupled two or more fluids to model dust species and gas simultaneously. The efforts and interest in the field make it now possible to perform astrophysical disk simulations on almost 100 thousand CPU cores as well as on GPU clusters. It is becoming a new area of HPC in astrophysics.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa189"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">09:00 - 09:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

In addition, DG methods also have attractive properties such as the conservation of mass, momentum, energy and also angular momentum, which are relevant when modeling typical problems in astrophysics, such as planetary formation. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>	</div> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess200-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess200" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>MS40 Recent Advances in Fault-Tolerant, Asynchronous and Communication-Avoiding Algorithms (1/2)</strong>, Room B3</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right">	<g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g>	</g></svg></div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g></svg></div> </div> </div> </div>	</div> </a>	</div>	<div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess200"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="table organizer-items session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Organizer(s):</div> <div class="td"> <div class="organizers inline"> <div class="author"> Dominik Goeddeke (University of Stuttgart, Germany)</span>, <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

In addition, the heterogeneity of the hardware mandates robustness, asynchrony, and communication-avoiding to be built directly into the methods, in order to achieve close to peak performance. Consequently, reliability and robustness must be built directly into scientific computing applications and numerical algorithms. In this minisymposium, we discuss the state of the art in fault-tolerant, communication-avoiding and asynchronous methods, focusing on, but not necessarily limiting the scope to, iterative solvers. The invited talks emphasize proven or provable novel algorithms and mathematical techniques beyond redundancy. Recent developments towards interactions with middleware and operating systems, as well as analytical or parameterised models, will also be highlighted. This workshop, a synthesis of the state of the field, will be accessible to non-experts and experts alike.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa108"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">09:00 - 09:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

Both domains are also highly dependent on the ability to produce, store and analyze large amounts of simulated data, often with time constraints from operational schedules or international coordinated experiments. The ever increasing complexity of both numerical models and high-performance computing (HPC) systems has led to the situation that today, one major limiting factor is no longer the theoretical peak performance of available HPC systems, but the relatively low sustained efficiency that can be obtained with complex numerical models of the Earth system. <br /><br />The differences in model complexity, as well as the temporal and spatial scales that were historically characteristic for climate and weather modeling, are vanishing since both applications ultimately require complex Earth system modeling capabilities which resolve the same physical process detail across atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its associated experiments have allowed us to observe the particles and processes that lie at the foundation of our current understanding of the physical world. Furthermore, the LHC and other high-energy physics (HEP) facilities continue to produce data at an ever increasing rate, allowing us to peer beyond the Standard Model.<br /><br />In order to filter, process, and analyze the data captured at particle detectors, the HEP community has had over the last decades an insatiable appetite for computing power. Today the LHC experiments record around 150 PB/year. The rate of interactions to be studied will increase by a factor of 100 in the next 10 to 15 years.<br /><br />Computing at the LHC experiments happens mostly in two domains. In Online Computing, data captured at the detector must be processed and filtered using near-realtime, high-throughput computing software frameworks. The reconstruction of a particle collision event employs a large number of complex algorithms before the results are stored for further analysis. Offline computing deals with the physics analysis of the large data sets captured by the detector and retained by the online computing software. <br /><br />In this session we take a closer look at detector simulation and data analysis in HEP experiments. Much work has been devoted in recent years to further develop&nbsp;the existing software frameworks to better take advantage of modern hardware architectures. This includes shared-memory parallelism, vectorization and support for coprocessors and accelerators. Furthermore, the recent advancements in the field of machine learning are finding a number of applications in high-energy physics. The presentations discuss these simulation and data-analysis frameworks in the context of high-performance computing and modern hardware architectures.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa161"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:30 - 14:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

The main application is for preclinical drug development, but the technology is also potentially applicable for human hand and breast imaging. In FMT, a light source shines onto the object and the light propagates into the object, where it scatters and is absorbed. It triggers a fluorescent material, which emits light at a different wavelength. The remaining light and the emitted light can be measured on the other side of the object. From the measurements, the fluorescence distribution should be reconstructed as accurately as possible. This is not only a relevant medical problem but also leads to a current topic of mathematical research. One important aspect is an accurate optical model containing information about the shape and heterogeneous scattering and absorption maps. Mathematically, the process can be described by the Boltzmann transport equation, which itself is expensive to solve.&nbsp;Furthermore, due to the high scattering in the near-infrared wavelengths, the inverse problem of fluorescence reconstruction is a mathematically and computationally challenging problem, requiring HPC.&nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of this minisymposium is to report on the continuing progress on mathematical and computational methods that aim at an improvement of the quality of the FMT image reconstruction.&nbsp;It brings together researchers from applied mathematics, computational science, as well as industry&nbsp;to discuss their work and exchange ideas.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa204"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:30 - 14:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

OsteoSense was strongly located in bones and rapidly cleared renally and MicroBubbles showed the longest retention in liver and spleen and low signal in the kidneys likely caused by fragment-retention. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa154"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">14:00 - 14:30</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

In addition, the heterogeneity of the hardware mandates robustness, asynchrony, and communication-avoiding to be built directly into the methods, in order to achieve close to peak performance. Consequently, reliability and robustness must be built directly into scientific computing applications and numerical algorithms. In this minisymposium, we discuss the state of the art in fault-tolerant, communication-avoiding and asynchronous methods, focusing on, but not necessarily limiting the scope to, iterative solvers. The invited talks emphasize proven or provable novel algorithms and mathematical techniques beyond redundancy. Recent developments towards interactions with middleware and operating systems, as well as analytical or parameterised models, will also be highlighted. This workshop, a synthesis of the state of the field, will be accessible to non-experts and experts alike.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa144"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:30 - 14:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

We present experimental and parallel performance results that show the efficiency of the methods. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>	</div> <div class="session-head submission" id="collapse-sess170-head"> <a href="#collapse-sess170" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="collapse-text"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td time"> </div> <div class="td title"> <span><strong>MS46 Still Toward First-Principles Simulations on Exascale Supercomputers</strong>, Room B1</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="td icon"> <div class="collapse-icon"> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-right"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1" id="Ebene_1" x="0px" y="0px" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" xml:space="preserve" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-right">	<g id="Page-1"> <g id="arrow-left"> <polygon id="Shape-Copy-3" points="20.1,33.2 19,32.1 27.8,23.6 19,15.1 20.1,14 30,23.6 "/> </g>	</g></svg></div> <div class="spotws-svg arrow-down" style="display: none;"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="48px" height="48px" viewBox="0 0 48 48" version="1.1" class="spot-svg spot-svg-arrow-down"> <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"> <g id="arrow-down" fill="#000000"> <polygon id="Shape" points="14.9042553 19.7178256 15.9574468 18.6646341 24.5 27.4412299 33.0425532 18.6646341 34.0957447 19.7178256 24.5 29.6646341"/> </g> </g></svg></div> </div> </div> </div>	</div> </a>	</div>	<div class="collapse" id="collapse-sess170"> <div class="session-body"> <div class="table organizer-items session-introduction"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td td-label">Organizer(s):</div> <div class="td"> <div class="organizers inline"> <div class="author"> Yoshitaka Tateyama (National Institute for Materials Science, Japan)</span> <script class="pasc-biography-item-json" type="text/template">

The Swiss National Computing Centre, which has the world No.8 Piz Daint (9.7 PFlops), announced that it will adopt NVIDIA Pascal GPU in conjunction with Intel Haswell CPU. On the other hand, in Japan, the Joint Center for Advanced High-Performance Computing and FUJITSU launched world No.6 Oakforest-PACS (13.5 PFlops), consisting of Intel Xeon Phi, and RIKEN, the centre of world No.7 K-computer (10.5 PFlops) by FUJITSU, announced that it will adopt ARM processors for the Post-K exascale supercomputer. Namely, there are two different directions: GPU-CPU and many-cores. In this trend, first-principle (mainly DFT) calculations codes need to be adjusted to either or both in the coding stage or the methodology.

In 1D, there was no contest: Lagrangian hydrodynamics was the clear winner. This approach is still seen today in stellar evolution codes, where the immense time spans that must be covered forces us to traverse at least the great bulk of that time span in 1D. In the 1960s and 70s, the debate moved to 2D. Lagrangian grids tangle, which gave rise to various mitigating techniques, such as slide lines and &ldquo;free Lagrange&rdquo; or &ldquo;continuous rezoning&rdquo; approaches. Eulerian grids cannot easily capture critical flow features, such as multimaterial surfaces, which gave rise to mitigating techniques, such as volume-of-fluid and front tracking approaches. In the 1980s, the seeds of modern SPH (smooth particle hydrodynamics) and AMR (adaptive mesh refinement) were planted in the Lagrangian and Eulerian camps, respectively. The simulation community then moved to 3D, where these new variants now play very important roles. In this minisymposium, we will explore the present state of the art on both the Lagrangian and Eulerian sides. For example, can Riemann problems play a similar role for improving shock capturing in Lagrangian codes that they play in Eulerian ones? Or viewing the debate from another angle, how dynamic can an AMR grid actually be at an affordable overhead cost? A potential outcome of the discussion in this minisymposium could be a small selection of test problems that could, in principle, be addressed by both approaches. Problems along the lines of &ldquo;I bet you can&rsquo;t do this&rdquo; would be fun, but only if they actually could be set up in the opposite approach without huge investments of time and effort. Problems that have been addressed in both ways in recent years that would be of interest to hear about in their present states of the art include:&nbsp;the common envelope star problem, formation of galaxies or other large structures in cosmology, the star formation and fragmentation, or planet formation, problem, or any of a variety of problems involving unstable multifluid interfaces and the development of turbulence. Contributions showing the state of the art in these domains will be presented from the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives. Contributors will demonstrate the potential for their favorite problems to become selected tests that could be used by the community in advancing this debate,&nbsp;and with that the level of technical proficiency on each side. This minisymposium is viewed as a mechanism to&nbsp;begin this debate afresh from a modern perspective. The selected presenters will engage the attendees, particularly with a goal of establishing a forum and a set of agreed upon test problems.</p> </div> </div> <div class="submissions"> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa215"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">13:30 - 14:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">

		{"submission":{"data":{"id":"msa182","code":"","type":"Minisymposium Presentation","title":"Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics: Methods and Astrophysical Applications","scientific_track":"","abstract":"The strengths of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) include low advection errors, the handling of arbitrary geometries and free surfaces, and naturally adapting to large density contrasts. These strengths, combined with its natural unification with the N-body techniques used for self-gravitating systems made SPH a common technique for numerical hydrodynamics in astrophysics. In the mid 2000s it became generally known that the commonly used SPH algorithms suppressed the growth of instabilities and gas mixing at phase boundaries.

These strengths, combined with its natural unification with the N-body techniques used for self-gravitating systems made SPH a common technique for numerical hydrodynamics in astrophysics. In the mid 2000s it became generally known that the commonly used SPH algorithms suppressed the growth of instabilities and gas mixing at phase boundaries. Since then, a number of improvements have been made to SPH algorithms to address these and other issues. Even with these improvements, SPH is still more diffusive and slower to converge than other methods, but ongoing algorithm development continues to address these shortcomings. These advantages and challenges will be discussed and illustrated with the problem of the dissolution of a cold cloud moving through a hot medium, and the modeling of protoplanetary disks. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="submission item" data-id="msa223"> <div class="item-warp"> <div class="table"> <div class="tr"> <div class="td"> <div class="time">14:30 - 15:00</div> </div> <div class="td"> <div class="submission-body"> <script class="pasc-abstract-item-json" type="text/template">
