One objective of PARDISO is to achieve a high efficiency on shared memory multiprocessing systems. A new parallelization strategy based on a dynamic two-level scheduling scheme is therefore explored. The method aims at minimizing cache conflicts and interprocessor communication costs and, at the same time, maximizing processor load balance and Level-3 BLAS performance. The synchronization events are reduced by one order of magnitude compared with a one-level scheduling strategy. This results in an efficient parallel sparse LU decomposition method. An overview of the two-level scheduling algorithm and the key algorithmic features of the solver PARDISO is given. Finally, numerical results and a comparison with another software package demonstrate the performance. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/twolevel-dynamic-scheduling-pardiso-improved-scalability-shared-memory-multiprocessing-systems"},

Thus, the rights of the people living in Germany have been improved with reference to the preventive instruments. The aim of the work was to find about the subject to what extent patients understand the subject and how many of them have such a preventive document. The area of research has been examined on the basis of a standardized questionnaire drawn up by means of anonymous data collection in the quantitative research design. After the pretest, the survey was done in form of a documented Face-to-face-questioning in the HELIOS hospital Leisnig. The sample size comprised 139 patients from which 84 patients (37 female, 47 male) agreed with the survey. 25 percent of the questioned patients knew the law of living will (Patientenverfügungsgesetz) and 27 percent knew about the content of preventive instruments. 46.4 percent of the surveyed patients, aged between 70 and 75, had at least one preventive instrument. 63.1 percent of the patients believed that a living will has to be in a written form. 21.4 percent said that, in addition, the document has to be authenticated by a notary public. A study by van Oorschot claims that between ten and 15 percent of the people living in Germany have a living will (van Oorschot 2008, p. 443, Sahm & Schroeder 2009, p. 98). The results of this study show a much higher proportion of existing living wills. For the majority of respondents a preventive instrument plays still a minor role, but 46 percent of the population already use a preventive instrument to make provisions for themselves. 27 percent did express their will in theform of a living will. Nevertheless, the survey shows a lack of knowledge of the correct handling of the living will.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/living-analysis-state-knowledge-patients-helios-hospital-leisnig"},{"title":"Parallel Sparse Direct Solver PARDISO — User Guide","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk"},{"first_name":"Klaus","last_name":"Gartner"}],"year":2014,"source":"PARDISO Project","pages":"0-65","volume":"0","websites":["http://pardiso-project.org/manual/manual.pdf"],"id":"53acf85e-660c-370f-a653-9f4c807458b3","abstract":"The package PARDISO is a high-performance, robust, memory{e\u000Ecient and easy to use software for solving large sparse symmetric and nonsymmetric linear systems of equations on shared{memory and distributed-memory architectures. The solver uses a combination of left- and right-looking Level-3 BLAS supernode techniques [15]. In order to improve sequential and parallel sparse numerical factorization performance, the algorithms are based on a Level-3 BLAS update, and pipelining parallelism is exploited with a combination of left- and right-looking supernode techniques [9, 11, 12, 14]. The parallel pivoting methods allow complete supernode pivoting in order to balance numerical stability and scalability during the factorization process. For su\u000Eciently large problem sizes, numerical experiments demonstrate that the scalability of the parallel algorithm is nearly independent of the shared-memory and distributed-memory multiprocessing architecture and a speedup of up to seven using eight processors has been observed. The approach is based on OpenMP [4] directives and MPI parallelization, and has been successfully tested on almost all shared-memory parallel systems.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/parallel-sparse-direct-solver-pardiso-user-guide"},{"title":"Constraint handling for gradient-based optimization of compositional reservoir flow","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Drosos","last_name":"Kourounis","scopus_author_id":"15735165800"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"6701544373"}],"year":2015,"source":"Computational Geosciences","identifiers":{"scopus":"2-s2.0-84952631629","issn":"15731499","pui":"606025876","sgr":"84952631629","doi":"10.1007/s10596-015-9524-5"},"keywords":["Adjoint formulation","Automatic differentiation","Compositional reservoir simulation","Continuous adjoint","Discrete adjoint","General constraints","Gradient-based optimization","Nonlinear constraints","Production optimization","Recovery optimization"],"pages":"1109-1122","volume":"19","issue":"5","month":10,"publisher":"Springer International Publishing","day":1,"id":"80cd1010-4648-3b65-becc-35e2154f33a8","abstract":"An adjoint formulation for the gradient-based optimization of oil-gas compositional reservoir simulation problems is presented. The method is implemented within an automatic differentiation-based compositional flow simulator (Stanford's Automatic Differentiation-based General Purpose Research Simulator, AD-GPRS). The development of adjoint procedures for general compositional problems is much more challenging than for oil-water problems due to the increased complexity of the code and the underlying physics. The treatment of nonlinear constraints, an example of which is a maximum gas rate specification in injection or production wells, when the control variables are well bottom-hole pressures, poses a particular challenge. Two approaches for handling these constraints are presented-a formal treatment within the optimizer and a simpler heuristic treatment in the forward model. The relationship between discrete and continuous adjoint formulations is also elucidated. Results for four example cases of increasing complexity are presented. Improvements in the objective function (cumulative oil produced) relative to reference solutions range from 4.2 to 11.6 %. The heuristic treatment of nonlinear constraints is shown to offer a cost-effective means for obtaining feasible solutions, which are, in some cases, better than those obtained using the formal constraint handling procedure. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/constraint-handling-gradientbased-optimization-compositional-reservoir-flow"},{"title":"Gate-stack engineering in n-type Ultrascaled SI Nanowire field-effect transistors","type":"journal","authors":[{"first_name":"Mathieu","last_name":"Luisier","scopus_author_id":"14421377700"},{"first_name":"Olaf","last_name":"Schenk","scopus_author_id":"6701544373"}],"year":2013,"source":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","identifiers":{"sgr":"84884757359","scopus":"2-s2.0-84884757359","pui":"369915190","issn":"00189383","doi":"10.1109/TED.2013.2278573"},"keywords":["Device scaling","gate leakage","quantum transport simulation"],"pages":"3325-3329","volume":"60","issue":"10","id":"23ff347b-aec9-3e36-8d52-445eb680d8f8","abstract":"— The electrical properties of gate-stacks composed of an interfacial SiO x layer and different types of high-κ dielectrics are theoretically investigated for potential applications as oxide layers in ultrascaled Si nanowire field-effect transistors with a gate length of 5 nm.

The solutions produced using these CAD systems are undoubtedly valuable from the point of view of applicability in sheet metal forming practice. However, this approach is time consuming and most of the design time is spent within these CAD systems. This paper presents the development of a computer-based approach for the evolutionary automatic design (EAD) of geometry and process parameters for industrial metal forming processes. The main characteristics of the solution methodology are the use of evolution strategies within the optimizer, the use of sheet metal formability as objective functions and a parameterization of die surfaces. The results of a comparative study of our EAD die surface generation against conventional CAD die surface generation for a representative structural design problem show the efficiency of the former. It is observed that EAD often finds the region of the search space containing the global optimum, thus supporting engineers in practice with automatic generated sheet metal forming tools. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate the effectiveness and the numerical accuracy of this algorithm and also show that a high performance implementation is feasible.
